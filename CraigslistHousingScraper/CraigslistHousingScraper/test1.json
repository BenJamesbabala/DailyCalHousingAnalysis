High ceiling heights, modern architectural elements, and expansive windows and skylight give this 1 bedroom plus den, 1 bathroom unit, an abundance of natural light.\n\nThis loft-style home is spacious, with an open living, dining, and work space. A beautiful open kitchen offers granite countertops, bamboo cabinetry, and top-of-the-line stainless steel Bosch appliances including a refrigerator, dishwasher, microwave, gas oven/range, Nest Thermostat, and garbage disposal. The straight staircase leads to the spacious second floor with one bedroom, a large walk-in closet, a den, and a good-sized bathroom with 2 wall-mounted Duravit sinks + custom built vanities, a tiled shower/bathtub, and high-grade lighting fixtures.\n\nDesigned by the award-winning firm David Baker + Partners, the individual townhouses at West End Commons combine the functional and stylish aspects of a loft with more traditional aspects of home design.

{"bathrooms": 3, "description": "\nRenters are facing really difficult times right now with very high rent, crazy security deposits, no pets being accepted and landlords want you to have perfect credit and income 3 times or 4 higher than the rent just to allow you to rent their house and pay it off for them. Then they want to increase the rent every time the lease it up and in many cases ask you to move so they can sell the house or move back into it. \n\nWe can send you all of the program information in writing just by sending a request. it includes all of our licensing information. You can call Lynne Duban the Finance Director at\n\nto qualify as long as you have a 580 or higher credit score and can document your income. We get so many people who worry this is a scam but everything we provide you is verifiable through multiple governmental sources.\n\nI have sold homes from Berkeley to Discovery Bay for 27 years. I have managed special financing programs provided by the State and Federal Government that encourage renters to become home owners by providing financing options that don't require perfect credit and in most cases cost less to get into than a rental these days. The financing is 30 year fixed rate and includes property taxes, and all the insurance. Simply put, people who bought homes 15 years ago are still paying the same payment they had originally and you will have the same payment 15 years after you buy the house. Landlords will obviously not be keeping the rent at the same level.\n\nIn addition there are tax benefits that you get as a homeowner that help most people save thousands per year in Income Tax. This is the part where many people start to think this is a scam or baloney in general. To help with that we offer two things. I am going to give you ways to confirm the information. In addition I can send you an e mail that has both detailed breakdowns on the programs as well as an e mail that has the properties available with pictures and details. \n\nThe programs that we utilize are FHA, VA, USDA Guaranteed, we also use CHDAP California Housing Down Payment Assistance Program, and CHFA California Housing Finance Agency. These last two programs are state based and provide almost 100% of the down payment you need for the FHA Loan. USDA and VA don't require any down payment. \n\nThis house in Discovery Bay is just 1 of 57 available in Brentwood and Discovery Bay. It offers 3 Bedrooms, 2 1/2 Bathrooms and over 2000 square feet and is in beautiful condition. Its on a 9000 square foot lot with a 2 car attached garage and side access right near the lake.\n\nThe other 56 houses range in size from 1,000-3900 square feet and 2-5 bedrooms. The monthly payments range from $1950-$3400. \n\nThe cost to move into one of the homes will typically be $3,000-$5,000. Your first payment will not be due until 30 days after you move in. \n\nTo qualify you will need the following minimum qualifications\nA credit score that is 580 or higher (You can check your score at credit karma if you aren't sure)\nProof of income in the form of 30 days paystubs and the last 2 tax returns\nNo Short Sale Bankruptcy or Foreclosure in the last 3 years\n\nEric Wexelman Licensed by the California Department of Real Estate.

{"bathrooms": 2, "description": "\nRenters are facing really difficult times right now with very high rent, crazy security deposits, no pets being accepted and landlords want you to have perfect credit and income 3 times or 4 higher than the rent just to allow you to rent their house and pay it off for them. Then they want to increase the rent every time the lease it up and in many cases ask you to move so they can sell the house or move back into it. \n\nWe can send you all of the program information in writing just by sending a request. it includes all of our licensing information. Most people qualify when they have a 580 or higher credit score and can document your income. We get so many people who worry this is a scam but everything we provide you is verifiable through multiple governmental sources.\n\nI have sold homes from Berkeley to Discovery Bay for 27 years. I have managed special financing programs provided by the State and Federal Government that encourage renters to become home owners by providing financing options that don't require perfect credit and in most cases cost less to get into than a rental these days. The financing is 30 year fixed rate and includes property taxes, and all the insurance. Simply put, people who bought homes 15 years ago are still paying the same payment they had originally and you will have the same payment 15 years after you buy the house. Landlords will obviously not be keeping the rent at the same level.\n\nIn addition there are tax benefits that you get as a homeowner that help most people save thousands per year in Income Tax. This is the part where many people start to think this is a scam or baloney in general. To help with that we offer two things. I am going to give you ways to confirm the information. In addition I can send you an e mail that has both detailed breakdowns on the programs as well as an e mail that has the properties available with pictures and details. \n\nThe programs that we utilize are FHA, VA, USDA Guaranteed, we also use CHDAP California Housing Down Payment Assistance Program, and CHFA California Housing Finance Agency. These last two programs are state based and provide almost 100% of the down payment you need for the FHA Loan. USDA and VA don't require any down payment. \n\nThis is just 1 of the homes that are available in San Leandro, Hayward, San Lorenzo and Oakland. THERE IS AN E MAIL LIST AVAILABLE THAT GIVES YOU ALL THE DETAILS OF THE PROGRAM AND THE INSTRUCTIONS TO GET QUALIFIED AS WELL AS PICTURES AND DETAILS OF ALL THE HOUSES. PLEASE TEXT OR E MAIL THE REQUEST WITH YOUR E MAIL ADDRESS SO I CAN SEND THESE TO YOU.\n\nThis home in San Leandro is 4 bedrooms 2 bathrooms and 1750 square feet. It has a 1 car attached garage and this is all on a lot that is almost 4,000 square feet. \n\nThere are 50 homes available from $2175-$3400 and the homes are 760-2200 square feet with 1-5 bedrooms. There are also Condominiums and Townhomes that have payments ranging from $1625-$2720 per month with 1-4 bedrooms and 680-1700 square feet. These properties will have a separate Home Owners Association due per month of $200-$430 per month. \n\nThe cost to move into one of the homes will typically be $3,000-$5,000. Your first payment will not be due until 30 days after you move in.\n\nTo qualify you must have at least\n1. A credit score of 580 or higher (credit karma is a place to check if you aren't sure of your credit score)\n2. You will need to prove your income with the last 30 days paystubs and the last 2 years tax returns\n3. No Bankruptcy in the last 2 years\n4. No Short Sale, or Foreclosure in the last 3 years.\n\nLicensed by the California Department of Real Estate Eric Wexelman\n\nI can respond fastest to texts and e mails as I can't answer calls when I am with my other clients.\n", "title": "OWN SAN LEANDRO HOME INSTEAD OF RENTING SPECIAL GOVERNMENT FINANCING", "price": 3100, "bedrooms": 4, "postingDate": 1456473600, "longitude": -122.124, "link": "http://sfbay.craigslist.org/eby/apa/5465700793.html", "latitude": 37.7024, "sqft": 1750, "numImages": 0},

{"bathrooms": 1, "description": "\nI am looking for one mature and reliable person to live in my adorable studio. There is a private bathroom, pull out love seat, a natural gas fire pit in the yard, a storage shed, a gas grill, and a few fruit trees. There is a kitchenette with a nice double induction burner, blender/food processor, induction kettle, microwave, convection oven, plenty of storage space,and mini-fridge. The room is fully furnished with queen bed, pillows, desk and chair, heater, sheets, towels, and kitchen supplies (including some staples like spices, rice, four, oil, etc). I will even consider letting you use my bike if you are trustworthy. The place is really cute with lots of light. The neighborhood is very quiet. There is a great park 2 blocks away and many groceries, coffee shops, laundromats, bars, and restaurants within walking distance. There is a bus at the end of the street that gets you right onto campus within 15 minutes or you can bike there in 15 minutes. You have a pretty great view of the city from the top of the driveway as this neighborhood is up on a hill. Landlord is fine with guests as long as you let her know.\n\nThe move in/out dates are semi-negotiable but you would have to be out by August 21st at the latest. $500 deposit (refundable assuming no damage). Rent includes all utilities. No pets - sorry. \n\nThere are a few odd things about the place. The cottage is a mother-in-law suite - as in: it is in the backyard of the main house where the landlord and her 2 children live. The bathroom that goes with the cottage is connected to the back of the main house. It is a private bathroom with only one entrance from the outside which is about ten steps outside the front door of the cottage. So you have to walk outside to get to the bathroom, but not far, and it is your bathroom alone. Also - there is no sink in the studio so you have to do dishes in the bathroom sink. I have a dish drainer setup in the bathroom and the sink is not prohibitively small. While this is a strange setup, I have never had issues with it at all.\n\nThe landlord will want to meet you but other than that you won't interact with her much. You basically have 100% privacy in the unit and backyard and it is nice and quiet.\n", "title": "Adorable mother-in-law suite in Berkeley/Albany", "price": 1300, "bedrooms": 1, "postingDate": 1456128000, "longitude": -122.285171, "link": "http://sfbay.craigslist.org/eby/apa/5460552817.html", "address": "Ordway Street at Manor Way", "latitude": 37.884812, "sqft": 160, "numImages": 7},
