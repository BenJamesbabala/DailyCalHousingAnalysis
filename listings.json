Then they want to increase the rent every time the lease it up and in many cases ask you to move so they can sell the house or move back into it. \n\nWe can send you all of the program information in writing just by sending a request. it includes all of our licensing information. Most people qualify when they have a 580 or higher credit score and can document your income. We get so many people who worry this is a scam but everything we provide you is verifiable through multiple governmental sources.\n\nI have sold homes from Berkeley to Discovery Bay for 27 years. I have managed special financing programs provided by the State and Federal Government that encourage renters to become home owners by providing financing options that don't require perfect credit and in most cases cost less to get into than a rental these days. The financing is 30 year fixed rate and includes property taxes, and all the insurance. Simply put, people who bought homes 15 years ago are still paying the same payment they had originally and you will have the same payment 15 years after you buy the house. Landlords will obviously not be keeping the rent at the same level.\n\nIn addition there are tax benefits that you get as a homeowner that help most people save thousands per year in Income Tax. This is the part where many people start to think this is a scam or baloney in general. To help with that we offer two things. I am going to give you ways to confirm the information. In addition I can send you an e mail that has both detailed breakdowns on the programs as well as an e mail that has the properties available with pictures and details. \n\nThe programs that we utilize are FHA, VA, USDA Guaranteed, we also use CHDAP California Housing Down Payment Assistance Program, and CHFA California Housing Finance Agency. These last two programs are state based and provide almost 100% of the down payment you need for the FHA Loan. USDA and VA don't require any down payment. \n\nThis is just 1 of the homes that are available in San Leandro, Hayward, San Lorenzo and Oakland. THERE IS AN E MAIL LIST AVAILABLE THAT GIVES YOU ALL THE DETAILS OF THE PROGRAM AND THE INSTRUCTIONS TO GET QUALIFIED AS WELL AS PICTURES AND DETAILS OF ALL THE HOUSES. PLEASE TEXT OR E MAIL THE REQUEST WITH YOUR E MAIL ADDRESS SO I CAN SEND THESE TO YOU.\n\nThis home in San Leandro is 4 bedrooms 2 bathrooms and 1750 square feet. It has a 1 car attached garage and this is all on a lot that is almost 4,000 square feet. \n\nThere are 50 homes available from $2175-$3400 and the homes are 760-2200 square feet with 1-5 bedrooms. There are also Condominiums and Townhomes that have payments ranging from $1625-$2720 per month with 1-4 bedrooms and 680-1700 square feet. These properties will have a separate Home Owners Association due per month of $200-$430 per month. \n\nThe cost to move into one of the homes will typically be $3,000-$5,000. Your first payment will not be due until 30 days after you move in.\n\nTo qualify you must have at least\n1. A credit score of 580 or higher (credit karma is a place to check if you aren't sure of your credit score)\n2. You will need to prove your income with the last 30 days paystubs and the last 2 years tax returns\n3. No Bankruptcy in the last 2 years\n4. No Short Sale, or Foreclosure in the last 3 years.\n\nLicensed by the California Department of Real Estate Eric Wexelman\n\nI can respond fastest to texts and e mails as I can't answer calls when I am with my other clients.\n", "title": "OWN SAN LEANDRO HOME INSTEAD OF RENTING SPECIAL GOVERNMENT FINANCING", "price": 3100, "bedrooms": 4, "postingDate": 1456473600, "longitude": -122.124, "link": "http://sfbay.craigslist.org/eby/apa/5465700793.html", "latitude": 37.7024, "sqft": 1750, "numImages": 0}, {"bathrooms": 1, "description": "\nCome live in a gorgeous loft in a historic Oakland firehouse offered at $3500.

There is a private bathroom, pull out love seat, a natural gas fire pit in the yard, a storage shed, a gas grill, and a few fruit trees. There is a kitchenette with a nice double induction burner, blender/food processor, induction kettle, microwave, convection oven, plenty of storage space,and mini-fridge. The room is fully furnished with queen bed, pillows, desk and chair, heater, sheets, towels, and kitchen supplies (including some staples like spices, rice, four, oil, etc). I will even consider letting you use my bike if you are trustworthy. The place is really cute with lots of light. The neighborhood is very quiet. There is a great park 2 blocks away and many groceries, coffee shops, laundromats, bars, and restaurants within walking distance. There is a bus at the end of the street that gets you right onto campus within 15 minutes or you can bike there in 15 minutes. You have a pretty great view of the city from the top of the driveway as this neighborhood is up on a hill. Landlord is fine with guests as long as you let her know.\n\nThe move in/out dates are semi-negotiable but you would have to be out by August 21st at the latest. $500 deposit (refundable assuming no damage). Rent includes all utilities. No pets - sorry. \n\nThere are a few odd things about the place. The cottage is a mother-in-law suite - as in: it is in the backyard of the main house where the landlord and her 2 children live. The bathroom that goes with the cottage is connected to the back of the main house. It is a private bathroom with only one entrance from the outside which is about ten steps outside the front door of the cottage. So you have to walk outside to get to the bathroom, but not far, and it is your bathroom alone. Also - there is no sink in the studio so you have to do dishes in the bathroom sink. I have a dish drainer setup in the bathroom and the sink is not prohibitively small. While this is a strange setup, I have never had issues with it at all.\n\nThe landlord will want to meet you but other than that you won't interact with her much. You basically have 100% privacy in the unit and backyard and it is nice and quiet.\n", "title": "Adorable mother-in-law suite in Berkeley/Albany", "price": 1300, "bedrooms": 1, "postingDate": 1456128000, "longitude": -122.285171, "link": "http://sfbay.craigslist.org/eby/apa/5460552817.html", "address": "Ordway Street at Manor Way", "latitude": 37.884812, "sqft": 160, "numImages": 7}, {"bathrooms": 1, "description": "\n[2534 Benvenue Avenue Apt #6]\n1 Bedroom, 1 Bath , 548 sqft, $2,150 / month\n12 Month Lease, $3,000 Deposit, Available June 1, 2016\n\n*** OPEN HOUSE: Under Renovation - Key Checkout @ Office (see below)***\n\nSpacious 1-bedroom apartment back on the market after renovations!

Then they want to increase the rent every time the lease it up and in many cases ask you to move so they can sell the house or move back into it. \n\nWe can send you all of the program information in writing just by sending a request. it includes all of our licensing information. You can call Lynne Duban the Finance Director at\n\nto qualify as long as you have a 580 or higher credit score and can document your income. We get so many people who worry this is a scam but everything we provide you is verifiable through multiple governmental sources.\n\nI have sold homes from Berkeley to Discovery Bay for 27 years. I have managed special financing programs provided by the State and Federal Government that encourage renters to become home owners by providing financing options that don't require perfect credit and in most cases cost less to get into than a rental these days. The financing is 30 year fixed rate and includes property taxes, and all the insurance. Simply put, people who bought homes 15 years ago are still paying the same payment they had originally and you will have the same payment 15 years after you buy the house. Landlords will obviously not be keeping the rent at the same level.\n\nIn addition there are tax benefits that you get as a homeowner that help most people save thousands per year in Income Tax. This is the part where many people start to think this is a scam or baloney in general. To help with that we offer two things. I am going to give you ways to confirm the information. In addition I can send you an e mail that has both detailed breakdowns on the programs as well as an e mail that has the properties available with pictures and details. \n\nThe programs that we utilize are FHA, VA, USDA Guaranteed, we also use CHDAP California Housing Down Payment Assistance Program, and CHFA California Housing Finance Agency. These last two programs are state based and provide almost 100% of the down payment you need for the FHA Loan. USDA and VA don't require any down payment. \n\nThis house in Discovery Bay is just 1 of 57 available in Brentwood and Discovery Bay. It offers 3 Bedrooms, 2 1/2 Bathrooms and over 2000 square feet and is in beautiful condition. Its on a 9000 square foot lot with a 2 car attached garage and side access right near the lake.\n\nThe other 56 houses range in size from 1,000-3900 square feet and 2-5 bedrooms. The monthly payments range from $1950-$3400. \n\nThe cost to move into one of the homes will typically be $3,000-$5,000. Your first payment will not be due until 30 days after you move in. \n\nTo qualify you will need the following minimum qualifications\nA credit score that is 580 or higher (You can check your score at credit karma if you aren't sure)\nProof of income in the form of 30 days paystubs and the last 2 tax returns\nNo Short Sale Bankruptcy or Foreclosure in the last 3 years\n\nEric Wexelman Licensed by the California Department of Real Estate. Texts and E mails are responded to fastest as I can't answer the phone when I am with other clients.

Then they want to increase the rent every time the lease it up and in many cases ask you to move so they can sell the house or move back into it. \n\nWe can send you all of the program information in writing just by sending a request. it includes all of our licensing information. Most people qualify when they have a 620 or higher credit score and can document your income. We get so many people who worry this is a scam but everything we provide you is verifiable through multiple governmental sources.\n\nI have sold homes from Berkeley to Discovery Bay for 27 years. I have managed special financing programs provided by the State and Federal Government that encourage renters to become home owners by providing financing options that don't require perfect credit and in most cases cost less to get into than a rental these days. The financing is 30 year fixed rate and includes property taxes, and all the insurance. Simply put, people who bought homes 15 years ago are still paying the same payment they had originally and you will have the same payment 15 years after you buy the house. Landlords will obviously not be keeping the rent at the same level.\n\nIn addition there are tax benefits that you get as a homeowner that help most people save thousands per year in Income Tax. This is the part where many people start to think this is a scam or baloney in general. To help with that we offer two things. I am going to give you ways to confirm the information. In addition I can send you an e mail that has both detailed breakdowns on the programs as well as an e mail that has the properties available with pictures and details. \n\nThe programs that we utilize are FHA, VA, USDA Guaranteed, we also use CHDAP California Housing Down Payment Assistance Program, and CHFA California Housing Finance Agency. These last two programs are state based and provide almost 100% of the down payment you need for the FHA Loan. USDA and VA don't require any down payment. \n\nThis is just 1 of the homes that are available in San Leandro, Hayward, San Lorenzo and Oakland. THERE IS AN E MAIL LIST AVAILABLE THAT GIVES YOU ALL THE DETAILS OF THE PROGRAM AND THE INSTRUCTIONS TO GET QUALIFIED AS WELL AS PICTURES AND DETAILS OF ALL THE HOUSES. PLEASE TEXT OR E MAIL THE REQUEST WITH YOUR E MAIL ADDRESS SO I CAN SEND THESE TO YOU.\n\nThis home in San Leandro is 4 bedrooms 2 bathrooms and 1750 square feet. It has a 1 car attached garage and this is all on a lot that is almost 4,000 square feet. \n\nThere are 50 homes available from $2175-$3400 and the homes are 760-2200 square feet with 1-5 bedrooms. There are also Condominiums and Townhomes that have payments ranging from $1625-$2720 per month with 1-4 bedrooms and 680-1700 square feet. These properties will have a separate Home Owners Association due per month of $200-$430 per month. \n\nThe cost to move into one of the homes will typically be $3,000-$5,000. Your first payment will not be due until 30 days after you move in.\n\nTo qualify you must have at least\n1. A credit score of 620 or higher (credit karma is a place to check if you aren't sure of your credit score)\n2. You will need to prove your income with the last 30 days paystubs and the last 2 years tax returns\n3. No Bankruptcy in the last 2 years\n4. No Short Sale, or Foreclosure in the last 3 years.\n\nLicensed by the California Department of Real Estate Eric Wexelman\n\nI can respond fastest to texts and e mails as I can't answer calls when I am with my other clients.\n", "title": "SAN LEANDRO HOME YOU CAN OWN ENDS RENTING GOVERNMENT FINANCING PETS OK", "price": 3100, "bedrooms": 3, "postingDate": 1457337600, "longitude": -122.124, "link": "http://sfbay.craigslist.org/eby/apa/5480587590.html", "latitude": 37.7024, "sqft": 1750, "numImages": 0}, {"bathrooms": 1, "description": "\n6363 Christie Avenue # 1721\nGorgeous 1 bedroom 1 bath @ Pacific Park Plaza with wide open views\nCoin operated laundry on the same floor as the apartment\n24 hour pool, fitness center, tennis and more\n24 hour secured entry\nMinutes to Emeryville Public Market\nFree shuttle to BART, walk to Trader Joe's, Berkeley Bowl, Bay Street and more!\nClose to freeways and minutes to SF by car or public transportation\nLaundry on same floor but not in the unit\nAvailable January 21st\nEmail me for details\nExcellent credit and references necessary\nNO PETS or SMOKING\n\n", "title": "Sky high 1/1 with a view, parking, pool, gym and great location!", "price": 2100, "bedrooms": 1, "postingDate": 1456992000, "longitude": -122.29478, "link": "http://sfbay.craigslist.org/eby/apa/5475213658.html", "address": "Christie Avenue", "latitude": 37.838626, "sqft": 768, "numImages": 13}, {"bathrooms": 1, "description": "\n\n\n\nImages are of similar unit\nVirtual Tour:http://toursler.com/461_24th_st_14\n\nAvailable now is this charming and bright well appointed studio.

There is a kitchenette with a nice double induction burner, blender/food processor, induction kettle, microwave, convection oven, plenty of storage space,and mini-fridge. The room is fully furnished with queen bed, pillows, desk and chair, heater, sheets, towels, and kitchen supplies (including some staples like spices, rice, four, oil, etc). I will even consider letting you use my bike if you are trustworthy. The place is really cute with lots of light. The neighborhood is very quiet. There is a great park 2 blocks away and many groceries, coffee shops, laundromats, bars, and restaurants within walking distance. There is a bus at the end of the street that gets you right onto campus within 15 minutes or you can bike there in 15 minutes. You have a pretty great view of the city from the top of the driveway as this neighborhood is up on a hill. Landlord is fine with guests as long as you let her know.\n\nThe move in/out dates are semi-negotiable but you would have to be out by August 21st at the latest. $500 deposit (refundable assuming no damage). Rent includes all utilities. No pets - sorry. \n\nThere are a few odd things about the place. The cottage is a mother-in-law suite - as in: it is in the backyard of the main house where the landlord and her 2 children live. The bathroom that goes with the cottage is connected to the back of the main house. It is a private bathroom with only one entrance from the outside which is about ten steps outside the front door of the cottage. So you have to walk outside to get to the bathroom, but not far, and it is your bathroom alone. Also - there is no sink in the studio so you have to do dishes in the bathroom sink. I have a dish drainer setup in the bathroom and the sink is not prohibitively small. While this is a strange setup, I have never had issues with it at all.\n\nThe landlord will want to meet you but other than that you won't interact with her much. You basically have 100% privacy in the unit and backyard and it is nice and quiet.\n", "title": "Adorable mother-in-law sublet in Berkeley/Albany", "price": 1300, "bedrooms": 1, "postingDate": 1457251200, "longitude": -122.285171, "link": "http://sfbay.craigslist.org/eby/apa/5479987306.html", "address": "Ordway Street at Manor Way", "latitude": 37.884812, "sqft": 160, "numImages": 7}, {"bathrooms": 1, "description": "\n2057 University Avenue was formerly known as the University Hotel.

Street parking is easy and ample. \n\n(IF YOU SEE THIS POSTING, THE APARTMENT IS STILL AVAILABLE. IT WILL NOT BE RENTED UNTIL THE CONCLUSION OF THE OPEN-HOUSE ON SUNDAY, MARCH 6, FROM 11:00AM-1:00 PM ------ I'M SORRY, I AM NOT AVAILABLE TO SHOW THE UNIT BEFORE THE OPEN-HOUSE ON SUNDAY) \n\nWe've completely renovated the kitchen with a BRAND NEW refrigerator, BRAND-NEW over-the-stove microwave, BRAND NEW kitchen cabinets and BRAND NEW kitchen sink and faucet. \n\nThe bathroom has also been COMPLETELY RENOVATED with a BRAND NEW toilet, BRAND NEW bathtub/shower, and BRAND NEW European-style bathroom sink fixture. The bathroom also offers BRAND NEW cabinets and BRAND NEW floor tile. \n\nThere is a nice laundry room on the premises with a coin-op washer and dryer. \n\nThere is a cute, beautifully landscaped backyard with a patio for hanging out, BBQing or entertaining. Each of the four units also gets it's own weather-tight outdoor storage locker, located in the backyard. \n\nThe yard is completely enclosed and fenced to keep intruders out and pets from wandering off. It is a pooch paradise! There is a redwood community table that seats up to 10 for a dinner party. . . If you like to garden, there is an area for you to plant vegetables or flowers...\n\nLocated just off West Grand Ave. near Adeline, this building is literally a five-minute, straight-shot drive to the Bay Bridge tollbooth!!! It's a five-minute drive to 880 and 580 onramps. 10 minutes to Emeryville, Berkeley or Downtown Oakland. Ten minutes to Ikea, Trader Joe's, Safeway Pak-And-Save, Nordstrom Rack, Bay Street Mall, Home Depot, Lanesplitter Pizza, Target, Best Buy! Very central and convenient... \n\nThe neighborhood is mixed-use with lofts, warehouses, art-spaces and various industrial workshops, etc. There are also lots of old Victorian houses in various stages of rehab, some gorgeous and some run-down. There is a new charter school (Vincent Academy) 1/2 block away. \n\nCrime in this neighborhood is mostly a thing of the past, with West Oakland's serious revitalization program underway. New development and creative people are flooding in from Berkeley and San Francisco and have turned this area into a neighborhood for artists, musicians and craftspersons. However it IS an urban neighborhood and can get very noisy sometimes... It's not Piedmont! Locals are sometimes hanging out on the corner, socializing and playing music. It can be like Mardi Gras at times. If you crave quiet and serenity, this may not be the neighborhood for you. It is a VERY friendly neighborhood, but can sometimes be noisy in the daytimes.\n\nThe building has a security fence around the perimeter, a security gate at the front entry door and each of the four apartment doors are individually gated, so tenants are SUPER SAFE.

We only process one person's or one set of roommates' applications at a time. The deposit takes the apartment off the market and is refundable for up to three business days. After that, it's non-refundable. Bring all of your documents at the same time, and we process your application well within the three days. If you pass, the deposit becomes the first $100 of your security deposit. If you don't pass, even if your application is processed after the three business days, we return the $100 to you. The $40 application fees are non-refundable once the applications are processed regardless of the result.Applicants must show combined income of at least 3x the rent amount per month gross (pre-tax) and good credit based in the U.S. If credit and income aren't met (and the applicant does not have overly poor credit) then a cosigner may be used. A cosigner applies in the same way with another $40 application fee. A copy of a passport or driver's license and proof of income is required for each application. Proof of income can be in the form of two recent pay stubs, social security checks, pension, trust fund or support checks, or tax returns.\nNote for new international residents: if you don't have a credit history in the U.S. because of your national status, you may be exempt from the credit requirement; however, you will still need to meet the income requirement and will be required to pay an increased security desposit.\nAll fees and charges, including move in fees, must be in the form of cashier's check or money order, payable to Picardo Arms.

Ready to sign a lease any time.\n\nSHOWINGS: Email/message me and we can set up an appointment. Serious inquiries only please.\n\nTHE STUDIO: Fossel Farm's sweet and artistically furnished golden yellow studio has refinished wood floors and faces into the front garden of our urban farm. It has a nice big window with Eastern exposure and great morning light. The kitchen is on the north wall of the studio with a small sink, compact gas stove, under-the-counter fridge--all quite new--and a three stool eating nook. Its full bathroom has a brand new standing shower and a nice tile floor. The closet is generous for one, fine for two. Zero-VOC paint throughout.\n\nTHE HOUSE: The Fossel Farmhouse is an Edwardian style 2 level house, built in 1911, organically rustic and resounding with charm. There are two 3BR apartments and 2 single room studios. It was renovated 15 years ago, with continuing improvements ever since, many of them handcrafted by your hosts. The exterior of the house is newly repainted with fresh colors. Shared brand new laundry machines are at the back of the house in a greenhouse-style laundry shed. The foundation is bolted and sheer-walled--very earthquake safe.\n\nTHE LOCATION: Right in the heart of the great little neighborhood of lower Shattuck Avenue just south of downtown Berkeley (where Shattuck goes down to 2 lanes), this house is 3 blocks to Ashby BART train station, and has a #18 bus stop right outside that takes you to either downtown Berkeley or Downtown Oakland. We are a 15-25 minute walk or 5-10 minute bike ride to the businesses and nightlife of all of the following: Downtown Berkeley, the Elmwood, Temescal, as well as CAL (UC Berkeley). 5 minutes to 24/580/880 freeway on-ramp. Walk score of 89. Great location!\n\nTHE NEIGHBORHOOD: The house is surrounded within a few blocks by local cafes (Nomad, Renaissance, Jumpin' Java), restaurants (Cafe La Pena, Smokey J's BBQ, Flaco's Taco's, etc), small loft developments, and a friendly neighborhood Irish pub (Starry Plough). Foodie favorites like Crixa Cakes, Sweet Adeline's Bakery, Emilia's Pizzeria, Easy Cajun, and Alchemy Collective are easy walking distance. Both Whole Foods and Berkeley Bowl, widely regarded as the best community market in the East Bay, are five blocks away. The neighborhood continues to develop rapidly with new restaurants and amenities opening all the time.\n\nTHE PARKING: The location offers plenty of long-term parking that's good for a week or more if you pay attention to the signs and avoid monthly or bimonthly street cleaning. Parking is 2 hours in front of the house, but only during the hours of 8am-6pm each day, so works easily for overnight parking. \n\nTHE PROPERTY: Our Edwardian farmhouse sits on a large fully-fenced double lot with a generous front yard, huge backyard, and two side yards. The property offers very nice rustic indoor/outdoor living. There are two outdoor eating tables w chairs, three shade umbrellas, teak lounge chairs, a copper firepit on brick hearth, ping pong table, outdoor hanging lights, lots of potted plants (succulents, aloe, orchids, bougainvillea etc), handcrafted red brick pizza oven with grill (half complete), art studio/shed, and kids area (sandbox, puppet theater, toys, scooters, trike, soccer goal etc). \n\nTHE GARDENS: Our vegetable and flower gardens which are mostly in the side and backyards consist of 20+ raised beds (always changing but some usual food plant suspects: chard, kale, mixed greens, arugula, potatoes, tomatoes, basil, strawberries, beets, beans, edamame, rhubarb, onions etc). We have 5 chickens on the north side of the house, our Angora rabbit \"bun bun\", and keep two low-risk honeybee hives on top of our art studio. Currently the front yard features morning glory vines, a lemon tree, Neroli orange tree, false bamboo, roses, potato vine, as well as an expanding herb garden and a sitting area for two with brick hearth. Lastly, there are four raised beds on the sidewalk with succulents and California poppies, as well as a peach and a walnut tree.\n\nTERMS: Studio is available April 1st. Rent is $2000 monthly, deposit is $2000. We pay high speeed internet, water, gas, electric, trash--you pay only rent. Fully furnished. Lease negotiable, but for the fall or through the spring is ideal.\n\nSHOWINGS: Message me and we can set up an appointment.

There is a private bathroom, pull out love seat, a natural gas fire pit in the yard, a storage shed, a gas grill, and a few fruit trees. There is a kitchenette with a nice double induction burner, blender/food processor, induction kettle, microwave, convection oven, plenty of storage space,and mini-fridge. The room is fully furnished with queen bed, pillows, desk and chair, heater, sheets, towels, and kitchen supplies (including some staples like spices, rice, four, oil, etc). I will even consider letting you use my bike if you are trustworthy. The place is really cute with lots of light. The neighborhood is very quiet. There is a great park 2 blocks away and many groceries, coffee shops, laundromats, bars, and restaurants within walking distance. There is a bus at the end of the street that gets you right onto campus within 15 minutes or you can bike there in 15 minutes. You have a pretty great view of the city from the top of the driveway as this neighborhood is up on a hill. Landlord is fine with guests as long as you let her know.\n\nThe move in/out dates are semi-negotiable but you would have to be out by August 21st at the latest. $500 deposit (refundable assuming no damage). Rent includes all utilities. No pets - sorry. \n\nThere are a few odd things about the place. The cottage is a mother-in-law suite - as in: it is in the backyard of the main house where the landlord and her 2 children live. The bathroom that goes with the cottage is connected to the back of the main house. It is a private bathroom with only one entrance from the outside which is about ten steps outside the front door of the cottage. So you have to walk outside to get to the bathroom, but not far, and it is your bathroom alone. Also - there is no sink in the studio so you have to do dishes in the bathroom sink. I have a dish drainer setup in the bathroom and the sink is not prohibitively small. While this is a strange setup, I have never had issues with it at all.\n\nThe landlord will want to meet you but other than that you won't interact with her much. You basically have 100% privacy in the unit and backyard and it is nice and quiet.\n", "title": "Adorable mother-in-law sublet in Berkeley/Albany", "price": 1300, "bedrooms": 1, "postingDate": 1458532800, "longitude": -122.285171, "link": "http://sfbay.craigslist.org/eby/apa/5502168952.html", "address": "Ordway Street at Manor Way", "latitude": 37.884812, "sqft": 160, "numImages": 7}, {"bathrooms": 1, "description": "\n\n\n\n\n\n2001 Fifth Street, Berkeley, CA - #508 | Berkeley, CA 94710\n\nAvailable: Now\n\n\n\n\nSWB Living | (855) 979-HOME (4663)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "title": "Wonderful Top Floor 1BR/1BA!

Then they want to increase the rent every time the lease it up and in many cases ask you to move so they can sell the house or move back into it. \n\nWe can send you all of the program information in writing just by sending a request. it includes all of our licensing information. Most people qualify when they have a 620 or higher credit score and can document your income. We get so many people who worry this is a scam but everything we provide you is verifiable through multiple governmental sources.\n\nI have sold homes from Berkeley to Discovery Bay for 27 years. I have managed special financing programs provided by the State and Federal Government that encourage renters to become home owners by providing financing options that don't require perfect credit and in most cases cost less to get into than a rental these days. The financing is 30 year fixed rate and includes property taxes, and all the insurance. Simply put, people who bought homes 15 years ago are still paying the same payment they had originally and you will have the same payment 15 years after you buy the house. Landlords will obviously not be keeping the rent at the same level.\n\nIn addition there are tax benefits that you get as a homeowner that help most people save thousands per year in Income Tax. This is the part where many people start to think this is a scam or baloney in general. To help with that we offer two things. I am going to give you ways to confirm the information. In addition I can send you an e mail that has both detailed breakdowns on the programs as well as an e mail that has the properties available with pictures and details. \n\nThe programs that we utilize are FHA, VA, USDA Guaranteed, we also use CHDAP California Housing Down Payment Assistance Program, and CHFA California Housing Finance Agency. These last two programs are state based and provide almost 100% of the down payment you need for the FHA Loan. USDA and VA don't require any down payment. \n\nThis is just 1 of the homes that are available in San Leandro, Hayward, San Lorenzo and Oakland. THERE IS AN E MAIL LIST AVAILABLE THAT GIVES YOU ALL THE DETAILS OF THE PROGRAM AND THE INSTRUCTIONS TO GET QUALIFIED AS WELL AS PICTURES AND DETAILS OF ALL THE HOUSES. PLEASE TEXT OR E MAIL THE REQUEST WITH YOUR E MAIL ADDRESS SO I CAN SEND THESE TO YOU.\n\nThis home in San Leandro is 4 bedrooms 2 bathrooms and 1750 square feet. It has a 1 car attached garage and this is all on a lot that is almost 4,000 square feet. \n\nThere are 50 homes available from $2175-$3400 and the homes are 760-2200 square feet with 1-5 bedrooms. There are also Condominiums and Townhomes that have payments ranging from $1625-$2720 per month with 1-4 bedrooms and 680-1700 square feet. These properties will have a separate Home Owners Association due per month of $200-$430 per month. \n\nThe cost to move into one of the homes will typically be $3,000-$5,000. Your first payment will not be due until 30 days after you move in.\n\nTo qualify you must have at least\n1. A credit score of 620 or higher (credit karma is a place to check if you aren't sure of your credit score)\n2. You will need to prove your income with the last 30 days paystubs and the last 2 years tax returns\n3. No Bankruptcy in the last 2 years\n4. No Short Sale, or Foreclosure in the last 3 years.\n\nLicensed by the California Department of Real Estate Eric Wexelman\n\nI can respond fastest to texts and e mails as I can't answer calls when I am with my other clients.\n", "title": "SAN LEANDRO HOME ENDS RENTING WITH SPECIAL GOVERNMENT FINANCE PETS OK", "price": 3400, "bedrooms": 3, "postingDate": 1460185200, "longitude": -122.124, "link": "http://sfbay.craigslist.org/eby/apa/5531017552.html", "latitude": 37.7024, "sqft": 1750, "numImages": 0}, {"bathrooms": 1, "description": "\nBeautifull and Elegant (Must See 1325qft)....

In the mid-1970's, the building became Oakland's foray into creating a public school dedicated to the arts.

You don't need to whisper, but you shouldn't shout either, Especially close by the locked connecting door. (Although solid and extra-thick, a door always transmits more noise than walls.)
