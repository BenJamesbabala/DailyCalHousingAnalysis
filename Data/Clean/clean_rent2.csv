Then they want to increase the rent every time the lease it up and in many cases ask you to move so they can sell the house or move back into it. We can send you all of the program information in writing just by sending a request. it includes all of our licensing information. Most people qualify when they have a 580 or higher credit score and can document your income. We get so many people who worry this is a scam but everything we provide you is verifiable through multiple governmental sources.I have sold homes from Berkeley to Discovery Bay for 27 years. I have managed special financing programs provided by the State and Federal Government that encourage renters to become home owners by providing financing options that don't require perfect credit and in most cases cost less to get into than a rental these days. The financing is 30 year fixed rate and includes property taxes, and all the insurance. Simply put, people who bought homes 15 years ago are still paying the same payment they had originally and you will have the same payment 15 years after you buy the house. Landlords will obviously not be keeping the rent at the same level.In addition there are tax benefits that you get as a homeowner that help most people save thousands per year in Income Tax. This is the part where many people start to think this is a scam or baloney in general. To help with that we offer two things. I am going to give you ways to confirm the information. In addition I can send you an e mail that has both detailed breakdowns on the programs as well as an e mail that has the properties available with pictures and details. The programs that we utilize are FHA, VA, USDA Guaranteed, we also use CHDAP California Housing Down Payment Assistance Program, and CHFA California Housing Finance Agency. These last two programs are state based and provide almost 100% of the down payment you need for the FHA Loan. USDA and VA don't require any down payment. This is just 1 of the homes that are available in San Leandro, Hayward, San Lorenzo and Oakland. THERE IS AN E MAIL LIST AVAILABLE THAT GIVES YOU ALL THE DETAILS OF THE PROGRAM AND THE INSTRUCTIONS TO GET QUALIFIED AS WELL AS PICTURES AND DETAILS OF ALL THE HOUSES. PLEASE TEXT OR E MAIL THE REQUEST WITH YOUR E MAIL ADDRESS SO I CAN SEND THESE TO YOU.This home in San Leandro is 4 bedrooms 2 bathrooms and 1750 square feet. It has a 1 car attached garage and this is all on a lot that is almost 4,000 square feet. There are 50 homes available from $2175-$3400 and the homes are 760-2200 square feet with 1-5 bedrooms. There are also Condominiums and Townhomes that have payments ranging from $1625-$2720 per month with 1-4 bedrooms and 680-1700 square feet. These properties will have a separate Home Owners Association due per month of $200-$430 per month. The cost to move into one of the homes will typically be $3,000-$5,000. Your first payment will not be due until 30 days after you move in.To qualify you must have at least1. A credit score of 580 or higher (credit karma is a place to check if you aren't sure of your credit score)2. You will need to prove your income with the last 30 days paystubs and the last 2 years tax returns3. No Bankruptcy in the last 2 years4. No Short Sale, or Foreclosure in the last 3 years.Licensed by the California Department of Real Estate Eric WexelmanI can respond fastest to texts and e mails as I can't answer calls when I am with my other clients.",37.7024,-122.124,1750,OWN SAN LEANDRO HOME INSTEAD OF RENTING SPECIAL GOVERNMENT FINANCING,7759,0 0,2,4,"Remodeled Single House in San Leandro, CA 94577.

It's a five-minute drive to 880 and 580 onramps. 10 minutes to Emeryville, Berkeley or Downtown Oakland. Ten minutes to Ikea, Trader Joe's, Safeway Pak-And-Save, Nordstrom Rack, Bay Street Mall, Home Depot, Lanesplitter Pizza, Target, Best Buy! Very central and convenient... The neighborhood is mixed-use with lofts, warehouses, art-spaces and various industrial workshops, etc. There are also lots of old Victorian houses in various stages of rehab, some gorgeous and some run-down. There is a new charter school (Vincent Academy) 1/2 block away. Crime in this neighborhood is mostly a thing of the past, with West Oakland's serious revitalization program underway. New development and creative people are flooding in from Berkeley and San Francisco and have turned this area into a neighborhood for artists, musicians and craftspersons. However it IS an urban neighborhood and can get very noisy sometimes... It's not Piedmont! Locals are sometimes hanging out on the corner, socializing and playing music. It can be like Mardi Gras at times. If you crave quiet and serenity, this may not be the neighborhood for you. It is a VERY friendly neighborhood, but can sometimes be noisy in the daytimes.The building has a security fence around the perimeter, a security gate at the front entry door and each of the four apartment doors are individually gated, so tenants are SUPER SAFE. We have never had a break-in, or any problem with crime in this building. Nobody has ever been hassled in the 8 years I've owned this building. The neighbors are nice.A cat or nice dog MAY be OK with a reasonable pet deposit. (Deposit amount dependent on the pet) The apartment rent is $1800/month.

It's a great location: three blocks/5-minute walk from University Ave. (including bus lines and Trader Joe's); a 10-minute walk to downtown Berkeley BART and west campus (along Oxford St.); and a 10-minute walk to the Gourmet Ghetto (Cheeseboard, Andronico's, Safeway, etc.).The street is residential and the neighborhood is very nice to walk around. Besides being close to North Shattuck and University Ave., we're also a couple blocks from the Ohlone Greenway (at Hearst and MLK) and about half a mile to the track at Martin Luther King Middle School (at Hopkins and MLK).The place:We have the entire top (third) floor of the house, which includes five good size bedrooms, two big bathrooms, and a kitchen/common area with hardwood floor, a dishwasher, and lots of natural light. The available bedroom is $860/month and has a window, a skylight, a mirrored closet and carpet floors. It's about 11 x 17 ft.We share utilities, which average to about $60/month (we have Comcast internet and TV, and also pay for PG&E and water). There is a coin-operated washer and dryer for laundry downstairs (shared by the four units); it's $1.25 to wash, $1.25 to dry. The house also has access to a bike rack and outdoor patio with some seating and a barbecue. Our landlord is responsive and takes great care of the place, including landscaping and addressing maintenance issues if they arise. We're all pretty clean, and it's been easy to keep the bathrooms and common areas nice -- we share the costs of trash bags, toilet paper, etc. (which usually isn't much; when someone buys something for the house, they mark it on our spreadsheet so it is incorporated into the rent).One last note: Sorry, but we can only have one person in the room, and aren't able to have cats or dogs in the house. Also, smoking is not allowed in the house.The parking situation:If you have a car, there's free parking on one side of MLK (excluding one street sweeping day per month), though it's a good idea to get a parking permit with the city for $55/year to be able to park anywhere in this part of town (you'd just need to re-register your car to this address).You'd be joining four awesome housemates: Louis is a 4th year PhD student at Cal. A native Midwesterner and adopted East Coaster before heading west, he is still amazed by the number of hikes within 2 hours of Berkeley. Officially, he's training to be an environmental and energy economist. Unofficially, he's an avid foodie, an amateur pianist, an up-and-coming runner, and a recovering night owl.Daniel is a 5th year PhD Student at Cal, who moved to Berkeley from Australia, although most folks think he sounds British (including some Australians). He loves reading, exercising, singing and coffee. He is indifferent to vegemite.Andrea is an Architectural Designer, working towards becoming a full-blown Architect. She is originally from Sacramento and loves sports of any kind, preferring to play them rather than watch them. She also loves to cook, hike, bike, ski, kayak, creative projects, laugh and likes to keep things clean and organized.Harrison is a jovial fellow who is fiercely proud of both his Bostonian and Greek heritages. He drives his car for Lyft whilst planning new travel adventures, and career moves. He also enjoys food, discussing politics, religion, and pretty much anything you want to talk about. He's an inquisitive soul.We're all pretty low-key and maintain an easy-going environment in our house; people do their own thing, but we're all friendly and chat when we're cooking/hanging out/watching TV in the kitchen/common area. People are also always welcome to have friends over for dinner, to hang out, etc. Please feel free to contact us with any questions, or to set up a time to stop by the house.",37.875074,-122.273433,0,$860 Room in great Berkeley house!

There is a kitchenette with a nice double induction burner, blender/food processor, induction kettle, microwave, convection oven, plenty of storage space,and mini-fridge. The room is fully furnished with queen bed, pillows, desk and chair, heater, sheets, towels, and kitchen supplies (including some staples like spices, rice, four, oil, etc). I will even consider letting you use my bike if you are trustworthy. The place is really cute with lots of light. The neighborhood is very quiet. There is a great park 2 blocks away and many groceries, coffee shops, laundromats, bars, and restaurants within walking distance. There is a bus at the end of the street that gets you right onto campus within 15 minutes or you can bike there in 15 minutes. You have a pretty great view of the city from the top of the driveway as this neighborhood is up on a hill.

Rent includes all utilities. No pets - sorry. There are a few odd things about the place. The cottage is a mother-in-law suite - as in: it is in the backyard of the main house where the landlord and her 2 children live. The bathroom that goes with the cottage is connected to the back of the main house. It is a private bathroom with only one entrance from the outside which is about ten steps outside the front door of the cottage. So you have to walk outside to get to the bathroom, but not far, and it is your bathroom alone. Also - there is no sink in the studio so you have to do dishes in the bathroom sink. I have a dish drainer setup in the bathroom and the sink is not prohibitively small. While this is a strange setup, I have never had issues with it at all.The landlord will want to meet you but other than that you won't interact with her much. You basically have 100% privacy in the unit and backyard and it is nice and quiet.",37.884812,-122.285171,160,Adorable mother-in-law suite in Berkeley/Albany,13002163,Oxford at Rose-Eunice,1,1,"Sweet cottage.

Then they want to increase the rent every time the lease it up and in many cases ask you to move so they can sell the house or move back into it. We can send you all of the program information in writing just by sending a request. it includes all of our licensing information. You can call Lynne Duban the Finance Director atto qualify as long as you have a 580 or higher credit score and can document your income. We get so many people who worry this is a scam but everything we provide you is verifiable through multiple governmental sources.I have sold homes from Berkeley to Discovery Bay for 27 years. I have managed special financing programs provided by the State and Federal Government that encourage renters to become home owners by providing financing options that don't require perfect credit and in most cases cost less to get into than a rental these days. The financing is 30 year fixed rate and includes property taxes, and all the insurance. Simply put, people who bought homes 15 years ago are still paying the same payment they had originally and you will have the same payment 15 years after you buy the house. Landlords will obviously not be keeping the rent at the same level.In addition there are tax benefits that you get as a homeowner that help most people save thousands per year in Income Tax. This is the part where many people start to think this is a scam or baloney in general. To help with that we offer two things. I am going to give you ways to confirm the information. In addition I can send you an e mail that has both detailed breakdowns on the programs as well as an e mail that has the properties available with pictures and details. The programs that we utilize are FHA, VA, USDA Guaranteed, we also use CHDAP California Housing Down Payment Assistance Program, and CHFA California Housing Finance Agency. These last two programs are state based and provide almost 100% of the down payment you need for the FHA Loan. USDA and VA don't require any down payment. This house in Discovery Bay is just 1 of 57 available in Brentwood and Discovery Bay. It offers 3 Bedrooms, 2 1/2 Bathrooms and over 2000 square feet and is in beautiful condition. Its on a 9000 square foot lot with a 2 car attached garage and side access right near the lake.The other 56 houses range in size from 1,000-3900 square feet and 2-5 bedrooms. The monthly payments range from $1950-$3400. The cost to move into one of the homes will typically be $3,000-$5,000. Your first payment will not be due until 30 days after you move in. To qualify you will need the following minimum qualificationsA credit score that is 580 or higher (You can check your score at credit karma if you aren't sure)Proof of income in the form of 30 days paystubs and the last 2 tax returnsNo Short Sale Bankruptcy or Foreclosure in the last 3 yearsEric Wexelman Licensed by the California Department of Real Estate.
