The bathroom has a pedestal sink and tile floors.\n\n\u2028We have parking in our fenced in backyard for $65 or under the building for $80. Deposit is $500. No cat or dogs. We also have a giant back yard. It's like a small park back there and there is additional space where people have gardens. There is a laundry room in the basement with four washers and four dryers. The machines are coin operated. There's a bit of bike storage down there as well. \u2028The heat is steam and we pay for that as well as water and garbage. Nice savings there. The lease is one year which turns into month to month. You really have to check this out.\u2028\n\nYou can also check out the you tube video of a studio. The video also shows the building and the grounds.\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=gQBENKWhG9E\u2028\u2028\"\n\nWe will have applications at the open house. If you have something put together already you can put it with our application in case yours doesn't have something that ours needs.\nWe do need to run a credit check through National Tenant Network and that will cost $15 per adult. There is no other application fee. We would like to have a check for the fee since we do not carry change while showing apartments.\nWe take applications and then choose based mainly on income and credit. Our application asks for the addresses and contact info for the last three apartments, employment info and contacts, other forms of income, large loan payment basic info such as car loans, your phone number and email, etc. This is just in case you want to save some time for yourself and have these things ready with copies that you can drop off at whatever open house you go to.\n",

Quiet, upscale residential neighborhood. A short walk to restaurants, bars, shopping, public library, post office, banks etc. It also has one of the best closed heated swimming pools in the country, many parks, trails, historic sight and one of the best views of the bay, swimming beach all in walking distance.\n\nA bright, sunny end unit with a private deck. .

It has everything that Sausalito and Tiburon across the bay have, just better: The heel is more beautiful, ask the painters who come to Point Richmond to paint scenery that they sell all over the world, and not there. The air is better, cleaner. There are four park, swimming beach, one of the best swimming pools, and a golf course that Sausalito and Tiburon do not have!

In short, I don't think you could find a better studio with everything that this has for $1700. The first open houses will be on Monday 22nd at 12pm & 6pm. Please meet outside. If I'm not there I'm probably showing the unit and will be back down in a few.\n\u2028\u2028540 Alcatraz avenue just down from Telegraph ave.\n\u2028\u2028This building was built in 1929. It has a large entryway with two closets. The living room is huge with large windows facing the hills. The living room has great 1920's wall mounted light fixtures and has a large walk in closet. The kitchen is big as well and has enough room for a good sized table near the windows in the dining area of the kitchen. There is no dishwasher or garbage disposal. The bathroom has a pedestal sink and tile floors.\n\n\u2028We have parking in our fenced in backyard for $65 or under the building for $80. Deposit is $500. No cat or dogs. We also have a giant back yard. It's like a small park back there and there is additional space where people have gardens. There is a laundry room in the basement with four washers and four dryers. The machines are coin operated. There's a bit of bike storage down there as well. \u2028The heat is steam and we pay for that as well as water and garbage. Nice savings there. The lease is one year which turns into month to month. You really have to check this out.\u2028\n\nYou can also check out the you tube video of a studio. The video also shows the building and the grounds.\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=gQBENKWhG9E\u2028\u2028\"\n\nWe will have applications at the open house. If you have something put together already you can put it with our application in case yours doesn't have something that ours needs.\nWe do need to run a credit check through National Tenant Network and that will cost $15 per adult. There is no other application fee. We would like to have a check for the fee since we do not carry change while showing apartments.\nWe take applications and then choose based mainly on income and credit. Our application asks for the addresses and contact info for the last three apartments, employment info and contacts, other forms of income, large loan payment basic info such as car loans, your phone number and email, etc. This is just in case you want to save some time for yourself and have these things ready with copies that you can drop off at whatever open house you go to.\n",

Proof of income can be in the form of two recent pay stubs, social security checks, pension, trust fund or support checks, or tax returns.\nNote for new international residents: if you don't have a credit history in the U.S. because of your national status, you may be exempt from the credit requirement; however, you will still need to meet the income requirement and will be required to pay an increased security desposit.\nAll fees and charges, including move in fees, must be in the form of cashier's check or money order, payable to Picardo Arms.

The bedroom can come furnished (full bed, dresser, nightstand, and lamp - see pictures) or not. It's about a 10 minute walk to Rockridge Bart and a 20 minute walk to the Berkeley campus (and the 51B runs along College). Safeway is a 5 minute walk away and Trader Joe's and Whole Foods are about 10, and it's a quick walk to all the charming Elmwood and Rockridge shops and restaurants. I'm a law student at Berkeley in my late-20s. I spend a lot of time studying, so I'm hoping to find someone that's pretty quiet and clean - but friendly too! Rent is $1350/mo (with a $1350 security deposit), and $35 application fee.\n\nIf you're interested, send me an email with a little about yourself and we can set up a time to meet and for you to take a look at the place.\n",

    "description": "\nI am looking for one mature and reliable person to live in my adorable studio. There is a private bathroom, pull out love seat, a natural gas fire pit in the yard, a storage shed, a gas grill, and a few fruit trees. There is a kitchenette with a nice double induction burner, blender/food processor, induction kettle, microwave, convection oven, plenty of storage space,and mini-fridge. The room is fully furnished with queen bed, pillows, desk and chair, heater, sheets, towels, and kitchen supplies (including some staples like spices, rice, four, oil, etc). I will even consider letting you use my bike if you are trustworthy. The place is really cute with lots of light. The neighborhood is very quiet. There is a great park 2 blocks away and many groceries, coffee shops, laundromats, bars, and restaurants within walking distance. There is a bus at the end of the street that gets you right onto campus within 15 minutes or you can bike there in 15 minutes. You have a pretty great view of the city from the top of the driveway as this neighborhood is up on a hill. Landlord is fine with guests as long as you let her know.\n\nThe move in/out dates are semi-negotiable but you would have to be out by August 21st at the latest. $500 deposit (refundable assuming no damage). Rent includes all utilities. No pets - sorry. \n\nThere are a few odd things about the place. The cottage is a mother-in-law suite - as in: it is in the backyard of the main house where the landlord and her 2 children live. The bathroom that goes with the cottage is connected to the back of the main house. It is a private bathroom with only one entrance from the outside which is about ten steps outside the front door of the cottage. So you have to walk outside to get to the bathroom, but not far, and it is your bathroom alone. Also - there is no sink in the studio so you have to do dishes in the bathroom sink. I have a dish drainer setup in the bathroom and the sink is not prohibitively small. While this is a strange setup, I have never had issues with it at all.\n\nThe landlord will want to meet you but other than that you won't interact with her much. You basically have 100% privacy in the unit and backyard and it is nice and quiet.\n",
