Safeway is a 5 minute walk away and Trader Joe's and Whole Foods are about 10, and it's a quick walk to all the charming Elmwood and Rockridge shops and restaurants. I'm a law student at Berkeley in my late-20s. I spend a lot of time studying, so I'm hoping to find someone that's pretty quiet and clean - but friendly too!

		"description": "\nI am looking for one mature and reliable person to live in my adorable studio. There is a private bathroom, pull out love seat, a natural gas fire pit in the yard, a storage shed, a gas grill, and a few fruit trees. There is a kitchenette with a nice double induction burner, blender/food processor, induction kettle, microwave, convection oven, plenty of storage space,and mini-fridge. The room is fully furnished with queen bed, pillows, desk and chair, heater, sheets, towels, and kitchen supplies (including some staples like spices, rice, four, oil, etc). I will even consider letting you use my bike if you are trustworthy. The place is really cute with lots of light. The neighborhood is very quiet. There is a great park 2 blocks away and many groceries, coffee shops, laundromats, bars, and restaurants within walking distance. There is a bus at the end of the street that gets you right onto campus within 15 minutes or you can bike there in 15 minutes. You have a pretty great view of the city from the top of the driveway as this neighborhood is up on a hill. Landlord is fine with guests as long as you let her know.\n\nThe move in/out dates are semi-negotiable but you would have to be out by August 21st at the latest. $500 deposit (refundable assuming no damage). Rent includes all utilities. No pets - sorry. \n\nThere are a few odd things about the place. The cottage is a mother-in-law suite - as in: it is in the backyard of the main house where the landlord and her 2 children live. The bathroom that goes with the cottage is connected to the back of the main house. It is a private bathroom with only one entrance from the outside which is about ten steps outside the front door of the cottage. So you have to walk outside to get to the bathroom, but not far, and it is your bathroom alone. Also - there is no sink in the studio so you have to do dishes in the bathroom sink. I have a dish drainer setup in the bathroom and the sink is not prohibitively small. While this is a strange setup, I have never had issues with it at all.\n\nThe landlord will want to meet you but other than that you won't interact with her much. You basically have 100% privacy in the unit and backyard and it is nice and quiet.\n",

		"description": "\nRenters are facing really difficult times right now with very high rent, crazy security deposits, no pets being accepted and landlords want you to have perfect credit and income 3 times or 4 higher than the rent just to allow you to rent their house and pay it off for them. Then they want to increase the rent every time the lease it up and in many cases ask you to move so they can sell the house or move back into it. \n\nWe can send you all of the program information in writing just by sending a request. it includes all of our licensing information. You can call Lynne Duban the Finance Director at\n\nto qualify as long as you have a 580 or higher credit score and can document your income. We get so many people who worry this is a scam but everything we provide you is verifiable through multiple governmental sources.\n\nI have sold homes from Berkeley to Discovery Bay for 27 years. I have managed special financing programs provided by the State and Federal Government that encourage renters to become home owners by providing financing options that don't require perfect credit and in most cases cost less to get into than a rental these days. The financing is 30 year fixed rate and includes property taxes, and all the insurance. Simply put, people who bought homes 15 years ago are still paying the same payment they had originally and you will have the same payment 15 years after you buy the house. Landlords will obviously not be keeping the rent at the same level.\n\nIn addition there are tax benefits that you get as a homeowner that help most people save thousands per year in Income Tax. This is the part where many people start to think this is a scam or baloney in general. To help with that we offer two things. I am going to give you ways to confirm the information. In addition I can send you an e mail that has both detailed breakdowns on the programs as well as an e mail that has the properties available with pictures and details. \n\nThe programs that we utilize are FHA, VA, USDA Guaranteed, we also use CHDAP California Housing Down Payment Assistance Program, and CHFA California Housing Finance Agency. These last two programs are state based and provide almost 100% of the down payment you need for the FHA Loan. USDA and VA don't require any down payment. \n\nThis house in Discovery Bay is just 1 of 57 available in Brentwood and Discovery Bay. It offers 3 Bedrooms, 2 1/2 Bathrooms and over 2000 square feet and is in beautiful condition. Its on a 9000 square foot lot with a 2 car attached garage and side access right near the lake.\n\nThe other 56 houses range in size from 1,000-3900 square feet and 2-5 bedrooms. The monthly payments range from $1950-$3400. \n\nThe cost to move into one of the homes will typically be $3,000-$5,000. Your first payment will not be due until 30 days after you move in. \n\nTo qualify you will need the following minimum qualifications\nA credit score that is 580 or higher (You can check your score at credit karma if you aren't sure)\nProof of income in the form of 30 days paystubs and the last 2 tax returns\nNo Short Sale Bankruptcy or Foreclosure in the last 3 years\n\nEric Wexelman Licensed by the California Department of Real Estate. Texts and E mails are responded to fastest as I can't answer the phone when I am with other clients. I WILL SEND YOU A FULL BREAKDOWN ON THE PROGRAMS AND HOW TO QUALIFY AND ALL THE PROPERTIES INCLUDING PICTURES AND DETAILS IF YOU TELL ME WHICH CITIES YOU ARE INTERESTED IN.\n",

If I'm not there I'm probably showing the unit and will be back down in a few.\n\u2028\u2028540 Alcatraz avenue just down from Telegraph ave.\n\u2028\u2028This building was built in 1929. It has a large entryway with two closets. The living room is huge with large windows facing the hills. The living room has great 1920's wall mounted light fixtures and has a large walk in closet. The kitchen is big as well and has enough room for a good sized table near the windows in the dining area of the kitchen. There is no dishwasher or garbage disposal. The bathroom has a pedestal sink and tile floors.\n\n\u2028We have parking in our fenced in backyard for $65 or under the building for $80. Deposit is $500. No cat or dogs. We also have a giant back yard. It's like a small park back there and there is additional space where people have gardens. There is a laundry room in the basement with four washers and four dryers. The machines are coin operated. There's a bit of bike storage down there as well. \u2028The heat is steam and we pay for that as well as water and garbage. Nice savings there. The lease is one year which turns into month to month. You really have to check this out.\u2028\n\nYou can also check out the you tube video of a studio. The video also shows the building and the grounds.\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=gQBENKWhG9E\u2028\u2028\"\n\nWe will have applications at the open house. If you have something put together already you can put it with our application in case yours doesn't have something that ours needs.\nWe do need to run a credit check through National Tenant Network and that will cost $15 per adult. There is no other application fee. We would like to have a check for the fee since we do not carry change while showing apartments.\nWe take applications and then choose based mainly on income and credit. Our application asks for the addresses and contact info for the last three apartments, employment info and contacts, other forms of income, large loan payment basic info such as car loans, your phone number and email, etc. This is just in case you want to save some time for yourself and have these things ready with copies that you can drop off at whatever open house you go to.\n",

		"description": "\nRenters are facing really difficult times right now with very high rent, crazy security deposits, no pets being accepted and landlords want you to have perfect credit and income 3 times or 4 higher than the rent just to allow you to rent their house and pay it off for them. Then they want to increase the rent every time the lease it up and in many cases ask you to move so they can sell the house or move back into it. \n\nWe can send you all of the program information in writing just by sending a request. it includes all of our licensing information. Most people qualify when they have a 580 or higher credit score and can document your income. We get so many people who worry this is a scam but everything we provide you is verifiable through multiple governmental sources.\n\nI have sold homes from Berkeley to Discovery Bay for 27 years. I have managed special financing programs provided by the State and Federal Government that encourage renters to become home owners by providing financing options that don't require perfect credit and in most cases cost less to get into than a rental these days. The financing is 30 year fixed rate and includes property taxes, and all the insurance. Simply put, people who bought homes 15 years ago are still paying the same payment they had originally and you will have the same payment 15 years after you buy the house. Landlords will obviously not be keeping the rent at the same level.\n\nIn addition there are tax benefits that you get as a homeowner that help most people save thousands per year in Income Tax. This is the part where many people start to think this is a scam or baloney in general. To help with that we offer two things. I am going to give you ways to confirm the information. In addition I can send you an e mail that has both detailed breakdowns on the programs as well as an e mail that has the properties available with pictures and details. \n\nThe programs that we utilize are FHA, VA, USDA Guaranteed, we also use CHDAP California Housing Down Payment Assistance Program, and CHFA California Housing Finance Agency. These last two programs are state based and provide almost 100% of the down payment you need for the FHA Loan. USDA and VA don't require any down payment. \n\nThis is just 1 of the homes that are available in San Leandro, Hayward, San Lorenzo and Oakland. THERE IS AN E MAIL LIST AVAILABLE THAT GIVES YOU ALL THE DETAILS OF THE PROGRAM AND THE INSTRUCTIONS TO GET QUALIFIED AS WELL AS PICTURES AND DETAILS OF ALL THE HOUSES. PLEASE TEXT OR E MAIL THE REQUEST WITH YOUR E MAIL ADDRESS SO I CAN SEND THESE TO YOU.\n\nThis home in San Leandro is 4 bedrooms 2 bathrooms and 1750 square feet. It has a 1 car attached garage and this is all on a lot that is almost 4,000 square feet. \n\nThere are 50 homes available from $2175-$3400 and the homes are 760-2200 square feet with 1-5 bedrooms. There are also Condominiums and Townhomes that have payments ranging from $1625-$2720 per month with 1-4 bedrooms and 680-1700 square feet. These properties will have a separate Home Owners Association due per month of $200-$430 per month. \n\nThe cost to move into one of the homes will typically be $3,000-$5,000. Your first payment will not be due until 30 days after you move in.\n\nTo qualify you must have at least\n1. A credit score of 580 or higher (credit karma is a place to check if you aren't sure of your credit score)\n2. You will need to prove your income with the last 30 days paystubs and the last 2 years tax returns\n3. No Bankruptcy in the last 2 years\n4. No Short Sale, or Foreclosure in the last 3 years.\n\nLicensed by the California Department of Real Estate Eric Wexelman\n\nI can respond fastest to texts and e mails as I can't answer calls when I am with my other clients.\n",

(Option to extend)\n\nWe are 4 international students looking to sublet our appartment in Berkeley for the summer (w/ option to extend after our contract expires). The appartment have 2 big bedrooms, with 2 beds and 1 built-in closet in each (which makes room for a total of 4 people). It also has a private kitchen, livingroom and bathroom (w/ shower and bath tub). You will have access to a common laundry room (w/ drying machenes) and a rooftop (perfect for those warm summer afternoons!). \n\n*We own some of the furniture (except a dinner table w/ 4 chairs which comes with the appartment). This includes a sofa, living room table, 4 beds, 4 chairs, kitchen equipment and 2 dressers (all from IKEA). We will offer to sell these to you for a reasonable price. Even better, we also have 3 bikes that you can choose to buy. We really recommend having bicycles in Berkeley, as it makes it really easy to go to Uni (and give you some more minutes to snooze in the morning..) and the nearby supermarkets (Berkeley Bowl is only 4 minutes bicycles ride away!). Best of all, you can park them in the parking garage, and we'll throw in 2 locks. \n\nVideo of the apartment: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9ZchX03UWI\n\nIf you want to move straight into a fully furnished appartment for easy living in Berkeley, this is definately your place!\n\nWe will be happy to answer any questions you may have. Please contact us in either telephone or email.\n",

There are bakeries, retail shopping, two supermarkets, and a host of other chow providers very nearby as well.\n\nNearby, the Temescal and Tilden Regional Recreation areas offer hiking and swimming. Enjoy Lake Temescal with its sweet beach, walking paths and fishing spots. We are within minutes of many other amazing hiking, biking, and riding trails and parks.\n\nThis home is less than five miles from UC Berkeley. PIXAR, Bayer, Kaiser Hospital, Summitt Hospital and Alta Bates Hospital are all within an easy drive. Downtown Berkeley and Oakland are 10-15 minutes close by. There is excellent transit availability on Broadway Terrace and Mountain Blvd. Commuters will appreciate the easy access to the Rockridge BART station.\n\nThis location is also ideal if you'd like to visit the Oakland Rose Garden or the Sculpture Gardens Jack London Square, the University of California, Berkeley, or Silicon Valley. Downtown Oakland has some of the best restaurants in California, not to mention a downtown lake, complete with gondolas and a running path.\n\nFor baseball fans, the SF Giants are 25 minutes away by car, BART, or Ferry. The Ferry drops you off at Center Field before the game and picks you up 20 min. after. The Oakland Coliseum, home of the fabulous Oakland Athletics, is 20 min away by car or BART. Street parking is free and ample.\n\nGetting Around:\nSan Francisco is only 20 minutes away, Muir Woods a quick 45 minute drive, and the wineries of Napa and Sonoma are an hour away. We are 20 minutes from Oakland airport and 35 minutes from SFO. BART, with a station just 1.5 miles away, goes into downtown Oakland and San Francisco, as well as to both airports. The ferry system, a more scenic mode of transportation, goes from Jack London Square to San Francisco, Marin, or Angel Island. From the Ferry Station in SF, you can get a boat to Alcatraz Island, one of the most famous prisons in the world. It makes for a wonderful day trip.\nDon't miss this rare opportunity to reside in a truly classic Montclair home!\n\nHighlights\n•\u0009Private woodland retreat in the Montclair hills.\n•\u0009Available partly furnished\n•\u0009Located on a large tranquil forested lot.\n•\u0009Spanish tile and carpet throughout.\n•\u0009Large sunny living room with corner garden view windows.\n•\u0009One bedroom upstairs via spiral staircase. 1 bath on main level.\n•\u0009Kitchen with tile floor, modern cabinetry, solid countertop, gas range top, microwave, refrigerator, stainless sink, modern lighting.\n•\u0009Abundance of natural light.\n•\u0009Soft tone neutral paint colors.\n•\u0009Excellent off-street parking.\n•\u0009Utilities paid by owner, gardening and garbage paid by owner\n•\u0009Asking rent $2200 monthly\n•\u0009Security deposit $2500\n• No pets/animals\n• Contact broker/property mgr, Frank Hennefer,\n\nBRE 00852682\n• Shown by appt only.

THANKS FOR REMINDING US. \n\nanything else that was neglected in the posting - feel free to ask\n\nThis unit is under 700 sqft.

Utilities (just cable and PG\u0026E) usually comes to about $30 a month. Parking spot available, coin-operated washer and dryer on site, hard wood floors, and is completely furnished. The lease is from May 2016-May 2017. Pets are negotiable.\nA little about us: We are both UC Berkeley students in our twenties and very stable (no drama or rent issues). He's studying Chemical Engineering and I'm studying Integrative Biology. We are both really studious and when we have free time we like to watch Netflix, cook awesome meals, explore SF/East bay, and go on runs/to the gym. We tend to be home bodies but the room we share is pretty big so you'll have your space. \nLooking for: Someone who is laid back, respectful, and relatively clean.\nLease renewal is due soon so we are looking for someone who can sign soon. \nIf you're interested, we can set up a visit and discuss details further. Thanks!\n*There is a queen sized bed in the room right now so it looks smaller than it actually is.\n",

You have complete access to Oakland, Berkeley, and SF with the serenity of a park-like atmosphere. The Marina has picnic and BBQ areas for you to enjoy year round.\n\nWhen you are not enjoying the spectacular views of the bay, enjoy touring around Oakland, Berkeley and San Francisco! There is also a kitchenette with a hotplate skillet, toaster oven, refrigerator, microwave, electric water kettle, and hand pumped water. Elegant lighting and curtains give a cozy feel in your home away from home. There is a twin sized bed and functioning toilet. On the back deck there is a small Weber gas grill.\n\nPrivate bath house and laundry facility with wifi and tv on the premises.\n\nI will respect your privacy, but I am on call if you need anything\n\nLocation, Location, Location! \n\nThis place is magical. The views of the Golden Gate Bridge and the skyline of San Francisco at sunset are breathtaking. People come here just to take photos at sunset. Emeryville is the center of the bay. There is an outdoor mall and shopping center within walking distance, and there is also a FREE SHUTTLE that will take you to these places. The mall has everything from the Apple Store to Old Navy and an AMC theater. Guitar Center, Trader Joe's and Bev Mo are just around the corner as well. If you want to get into the city of San Francisco, we are located right across the bay and have what I call a private driveway into the city, as the on ramp to the Bay Bridge is just at the end of the marina.\n\nPublic transit is free! The Emery-go-Round is a shuttle that comes every 15 minutes and will take you to the local shops and BART.\n\nThe wifi is spotty. It works ok, but I use a range extending antenna and that gives me no problems. Amped wireless is the brand name.\n\nYou have complete access to all parts of the boat, however, I do ask that you refrain from operating any valves, rigging, or the motor.\n\nI only ask that you respect the boat and all her inner workings. The toilet is does not accept solid waste, but there is a Private Bath house with large showers and a laundry room with a TV and WiFi. This is a private marina so please respect the guests and residents here by keeping down the noise levels. Also, you will need access keys that I will provide. You will be responsible for lost keys at the rate of $100 per key. Thank you. Happy House Hunting!\n",

There are only 3 stops before you get to the first stop in SF (Embarcadero). It takes 18 minutes to get to San Francisco. You literally DON'T need a car. You can walk or bike to Berkeley Bowl (Berkeley equivalent to Whole Foods but better prices and fruit / veggie selection), Walgreens, 5 cafes, 3 corner stores, art galleries and much more. You are literally in the \"center\" of Berkeley (from our perspective).\n\nThe house was completely renovated from Oct 15-Jan 16 (last month):\nBEDROOMS: See below for detailed explanation. ALL PILLOWS AND DOWN COMFORTERS AND OF COURSE SHEETS ARE WASHED BEFORE A NEW PARTY ARRIVES\nPLUMBING: New on demand water heater and plumbing (great pressure) to allow all 4 bathrooms, the dishwasher and washing machine to run at once with unlimited hot water.

All new high end appliances, 5 burner stove, dishwasher, microwave, sink, fridge and large stackable washer dryer\nWHOLE HOUSE INSIDE AND OUTSIDE:: Painted 2 weeks ago, brand new double paned windows, digital entry locks (reset for each guest). Large stackable washer dryer in unit on main floor.\nBACKYARD: Bonfire. Huge back yard with brand new 9 foot redwood fence / bamboo surrounding property and organic vegetable garden you can eat from. Water fountain. Teak tables with heat lamps and umbrellas to seat 16 if needed. High chairs and boosters included\nINGROUND HOT TUB: will be complete may 15\n\n\nNEIGHBORS: We live next door in a 3 story craftsman and are the most chill family you'll ever meet - if you decide you want to :) We are not nosy - you'll probably never see us. We don't care if you have parties (no keg stands), there is no curfew (the area has huge lots so no one cares if you make a little noise or have a bonfire. We are one of the neighbors and the other side are the most mellow people in the world.\n",

		"description": "\nRenters are facing really difficult times right now with very high rent, crazy security deposits, no pets being accepted and landlords want you to have perfect credit and income 3 times or 4 higher than the rent just to allow you to rent their house and pay it off for them. Then they want to increase the rent every time the lease it up and in many cases ask you to move so they can sell the house or move back into it. \n\nWe can send you all of the program information in writing just by sending a request. it includes all of our licensing information. Most people qualify when they have a 620 or higher credit score and can document your income. We get so many people who worry this is a scam but everything we provide you is verifiable through multiple governmental sources.\n\nI have sold homes from Berkeley to Discovery Bay for 27 years. I have managed special financing programs provided by the State and Federal Government that encourage renters to become home owners by providing financing options that don't require perfect credit and in most cases cost less to get into than a rental these days. The financing is 30 year fixed rate and includes property taxes, and all the insurance. Simply put, people who bought homes 15 years ago are still paying the same payment they had originally and you will have the same payment 15 years after you buy the house. Landlords will obviously not be keeping the rent at the same level.\n\nIn addition there are tax benefits that you get as a homeowner that help most people save thousands per year in Income Tax. This is the part where many people start to think this is a scam or baloney in general. To help with that we offer two things. I am going to give you ways to confirm the information. In addition I can send you an e mail that has both detailed breakdowns on the programs as well as an e mail that has the properties available with pictures and details. \n\nThe programs that we utilize are FHA, VA, USDA Guaranteed, we also use CHDAP California Housing Down Payment Assistance Program, and CHFA California Housing Finance Agency. These last two programs are state based and provide almost 100% of the down payment you need for the FHA Loan. USDA and VA don't require any down payment. \n\nThis is just 1 of the homes that are available in San Leandro, Hayward, San Lorenzo and Oakland. THERE IS AN E MAIL LIST AVAILABLE THAT GIVES YOU ALL THE DETAILS OF THE PROGRAM AND THE INSTRUCTIONS TO GET QUALIFIED AS WELL AS PICTURES AND DETAILS OF ALL THE HOUSES. PLEASE TEXT OR E MAIL THE REQUEST WITH YOUR E MAIL ADDRESS SO I CAN SEND THESE TO YOU.\n\nThis home in San Leandro is 4 bedrooms 2 bathrooms and 1750 square feet. It has a 1 car attached garage and this is all on a lot that is almost 4,000 square feet. \n\nThere are 50 homes available from $2175-$3400 and the homes are 760-2200 square feet with 1-5 bedrooms. There are also Condominiums and Townhomes that have payments ranging from $1625-$2720 per month with 1-4 bedrooms and 680-1700 square feet. These properties will have a separate Home Owners Association due per month of $200-$430 per month. \n\nThe cost to move into one of the homes will typically be $3,000-$5,000. Your first payment will not be due until 30 days after you move in.\n\nTo qualify you must have at least\n1. A credit score of 620 or higher (credit karma is a place to check if you aren't sure of your credit score)\n2. You will need to prove your income with the last 30 days paystubs and the last 2 years tax returns\n3. No Bankruptcy in the last 2 years\n4. No Short Sale, or Foreclosure in the last 3 years.\n\nLicensed by the California Department of Real Estate Eric Wexelman\n\nI can respond fastest to texts and e mails as I can't answer calls when I am with my other clients.\n",

		"description": "\nI am looking for one mature and reliable person to live in my adorable studio. There is a private bathroom, pull out love seat, a natural gas fire pit in the yard, a storage shed, a gas grill, and a few fruit trees. There is a kitchenette with a nice double induction burner, blender/food processor, induction kettle, microwave, convection oven, plenty of storage space,and mini-fridge. The room is fully furnished with queen bed, pillows, desk and chair, heater, sheets, towels, and kitchen supplies (including some staples like spices, rice, four, oil, etc). I will even consider letting you use my bike if you are trustworthy. The place is really cute with lots of light. The neighborhood is very quiet. There is a great park 2 blocks away and many groceries, coffee shops, laundromats, bars, and restaurants within walking distance. There is a bus at the end of the street that gets you right onto campus within 15 minutes or you can bike there in 15 minutes. You have a pretty great view of the city from the top of the driveway as this neighborhood is up on a hill. Landlord is fine with guests as long as you let her know.\n\nThe move in/out dates are semi-negotiable but you would have to be out by August 21st at the latest. $500 deposit (refundable assuming no damage). Rent includes all utilities. No pets - sorry. \n\nThere are a few odd things about the place. The cottage is a mother-in-law suite - as in: it is in the backyard of the main house where the landlord and her 2 children live. The bathroom that goes with the cottage is connected to the back of the main house. It is a private bathroom with only one entrance from the outside which is about ten steps outside the front door of the cottage. So you have to walk outside to get to the bathroom, but not far, and it is your bathroom alone. Also - there is no sink in the studio so you have to do dishes in the bathroom sink. I have a dish drainer setup in the bathroom and the sink is not prohibitively small. While this is a strange setup, I have never had issues with it at all.\n\nThe landlord will want to meet you but other than that you won't interact with her much. You basically have 100% privacy in the unit and backyard and it is nice and quiet.\n",

Another wards, you basically are in your own space! I lived out there for a bit and it is so lovely. \n\n975.00 includes WIFI, utilities, laundry, total use of the kitchen and bathroom. And cats to love you ! Expected is first months rent plus security deposit and rental agreement signed with references of work or school. \n\nI am in the main home in front. You will be sharing the big kitchen with me ( 3 cats ) and the bathroom. The home is really nicely laid out for solitude and privacy. The area has so much to offer! Walking distance to many wonderful places from micro brewery to whole foods and Apple. \n\n\nI would prefer a progressive thinker ( Trump voters please dont bother to respond to this ad) , a good communicator, especially of your requests and feelings. LGBT are welcome and animal lovers only apply please. My cats are my family! If that sounds nuts then its not a good fit for you. \nLess is more here and recycling is a law in Berkeley. It is a very relaxed home yet not so into loud partying here. I dont mind friends or family overnite stays, but only for more then a handful of days a month. The cottage is too small for more then one.\n\nAbout me: I am of 49 yrs and in the healing profession. When I am home, I much need space to regroup, but the weekends I do enjoy gathering socially, a brunch or doing something active together. Maybe a hike or bike ride? \n\nPlease respond with a bit about you and what you have in mind as a great place to be for how long? I look forward to hearing from you. \n\nBe well -\n",

		"description": "\nHello,\nI'm looking for someone to take over my lease in April. The lease is until January 8, 2017. My rent is $150 lower than what the apartment complex currently charges. We will need to go through the leasing office to make the lease transfer official. Deposit is $400.\n\n---\n\nThis is a huge one-bedroom apartment on the fourth floor of a five-story building facing the Berkeley Hills in a well lit, quiet neighborhood with all the conveniences nearby. The name of the property is Icon at Park. Inside the apartment is very quiet, you will not hear your neighbors due to solid concrete construction! Here are the highlights: huge walk-in closet with washer and dryer, large bedroom closet, huge kitchen with granite countertops and nice appliances, separate office area that could be used as a guest bedroom, bathroom has a deep soaking tub and granite vanity top, nice balcony for your gas or electric grill, reserved parking spot in the secure garage, bike storage in the garage, on-site gym. Maintenance and management are very responsive to any requests, plus there's a friendly cleaning lady who takes care of common areas five days a week, so the entire property is very neat at all times!\n\nThe apartment is in great shape, but I'll pay for professional carpet cleaning and paint touch ups before moving out. I'm available to show the property during weekdays by appointment or during weekends.\n\nFor an additional cost, I can leave a very comfortable couch and a queen size bed with a really nice mattress, everything is just about a year old. These items are shown on the pictures. \n\nHere's more info about the complex: https://prometheusreg.com/san-francisco-properties/icon-at-park\n",

Street parking is easy and ample. \n\n(IF YOU SEE THIS POSTING, THE APARTMENT IS STILL AVAILABLE. IT WILL NOT BE RENTED UNTIL THE CONCLUSION OF THE OPEN-HOUSE ON SUNDAY, MARCH 6, FROM 11:00AM-1:00 PM ------ I'M SORRY, I AM NOT AVAILABLE TO SHOW THE UNIT BEFORE THE OPEN-HOUSE ON SUNDAY) \n\nWe've completely renovated the kitchen with a BRAND NEW refrigerator, BRAND-NEW over-the-stove microwave, BRAND NEW kitchen cabinets and BRAND NEW kitchen sink and faucet. \n\nThe bathroom has also been COMPLETELY RENOVATED with a BRAND NEW toilet, BRAND NEW bathtub/shower, and BRAND NEW European-style bathroom sink fixture. The bathroom also offers BRAND NEW cabinets and BRAND NEW floor tile. \n\nThere is a nice laundry room on the premises with a coin-op washer and dryer. \n\nThere is a cute, beautifully landscaped backyard with a patio for hanging out, BBQing or entertaining. Each of the four units also gets it's own weather-tight outdoor storage locker, located in the backyard. \n\nThe yard is completely enclosed and fenced to keep intruders out and pets from wandering off. It is a pooch paradise! There is a redwood community table that seats up to 10 for a dinner party. . . If you like to garden, there is an area for you to plant vegetables or flowers...\n\nLocated just off West Grand Ave. near Adeline, this building is literally a five-minute, straight-shot drive to the Bay Bridge tollbooth!!! It's a five-minute drive to 880 and 580 onramps. 10 minutes to Emeryville, Berkeley or Downtown Oakland. Ten minutes to Ikea, Trader Joe's, Safeway Pak-And-Save, Nordstrom Rack, Bay Street Mall, Home Depot, Lanesplitter Pizza, Target, Best Buy! Very central and convenient... \n\nThe neighborhood is mixed-use with lofts, warehouses, art-spaces and various industrial workshops, etc. There are also lots of old Victorian houses in various stages of rehab, some gorgeous and some run-down. There is a new charter school (Vincent Academy) 1/2 block away. \n\nCrime in this neighborhood is mostly a thing of the past, with West Oakland's serious revitalization program underway. New development and creative people are flooding in from Berkeley and San Francisco and have turned this area into a neighborhood for artists, musicians and craftspersons. However it IS an urban neighborhood and can get very noisy sometimes... It's not Piedmont! Locals are sometimes hanging out on the corner, socializing and playing music. It can be like Mardi Gras at times. If you crave quiet and serenity, this may not be the neighborhood for you. It is a VERY friendly neighborhood, but can sometimes be noisy in the daytimes.\n\nThe building has a security fence around the perimeter, a security gate at the front entry door and each of the four apartment doors are individually gated, so tenants are SUPER SAFE. We have never had a break-in, or any problem with crime in this building. Nobody has ever been hassled in the 8 years I've owned this building. The neighbors are nice.\n\nA cat or nice dog MAY be OK with a reasonable pet deposit. (Deposit amount dependent on the pet) \n\nThe apartment rent is $1800/month. SORRY, NO SECTION 8 ACCEPTED. \n\n$1800 refundable security deposit to move in. One UPSTAIRS apartment is available NOW! \n\nTenant pays PGE gas and electric. Owner pays water and trash. \n\nI'll be showing the apartment SUNDAY, March 6, FROM 11:00am - 1:00PM\n\nPlease come by during those hours to view the place and meet me... The address is 1084 24th St. Oakland CA 94607. (Major cross-streets are West Grand and Adeline) \n\nApplications will be available at the time of the showing, or you may bring a renters resume. Pay stubs and/or credit reports are also welcome, but not mandatory for consideration.\n\nTHANKS\n\njeff\n",

The $40 application fees are non-refundable once the applications are processed regardless of the result.Applicants must show combined income of at least 3x the rent amount per month gross (pre-tax) and good credit based in the U.S. If credit and income aren't met (and the applicant does not have overly poor credit) then a cosigner may be used.

Proof of income can be in the form of two recent pay stubs, social security checks, pension, trust fund or support checks, or tax returns.\nNote for new international residents: if you don't have a credit history in the U.S. because of your national status, you may be exempt from the credit requirement; however, you will still need to meet the income requirement and will be required to pay an increased security desposit.\nAll fees and charges, including move in fees, must be in the form of cashier's check or money order, payable to Picardo Arms.

		"description": "\nThis one bedroom apartment is a cozy, quiet escape from the busyness of Berkeley. With high vaulted wood beam ceilings, a skylight, and a small wood-burning fireplace, this residence feels like a cabin. It has one spacious bedroom (including two large closets), one bathroom, a large living room, and a charming kitchen, making this apartment perfect for one resident. The apartment itself is tucked off the street, mitigating traffic noise. It has a small side yard, and is surrounded by large trees (redwoods) which keep the apartment cool through the summer. Its location is just off Ashby Ave, right near it's intersection with College Ave. It is close to public transportation, with the 51B stop at College and Ashby being on the same block. Also, as it is right off of College Ave, this apartment is no more than a five minute walk from a bakery, Elmwood Cafe, Ici's, La Med, and other great restaurants and small businesses.\n\nPer the landlord's request, this is a non-smoking apartment, with no pets allowed.\n\nI will be showing the place Friday (March 4th) from 11:30am - 2pm, or Sunday (March 6th) from 3pm-5pm. Please feel free to email me to let me know you are coming, and I will send you the address. When you get here, the apartment is tucked behind a large wood-shingled house. Just walk down the driveway (the driveway to the left of the house if you are facing it) and once you see the carport, turn right. The apartment door will be open. \n\n*note - due to high interest in the property, I am only able to respond via email. Please check your spam folder if you have not yet received a response*\n",

		"description": "\nThe basics:\n*Room available for $860 in 5-bedroom, 2-bathroom unit\n*Northwest of campus at MLK Jr. Way \u0026 Francisco St.\n*Available April 1st\n*Gender balance: 2 girls, 3 guys\n\nThe location:\nWe're in a 5-bedroom, 2-bathroom unit in a big Victorian-looking house (the house is divided into four separate units) in downtown/north Berkeley. It's a great location: three blocks/5-minute walk from University Ave. (including bus lines and Trader Joe's); a 10-minute walk to downtown Berkeley BART and west campus (along Oxford St.); and a 10-minute walk to the Gourmet Ghetto (Cheeseboard, Andronico's, Safeway, etc.).\n\nThe street is residential and the neighborhood is very nice to walk around. Besides being close to North Shattuck and University Ave., we're also a couple blocks from the Ohlone Greenway (at Hearst and MLK) and about half a mile to the track at Martin Luther King Middle School (at Hopkins and MLK).\n\nThe place:\nWe have the entire top (third) floor of the house, which includes five good size bedrooms, two big bathrooms, and a kitchen/common area with hardwood floor, a dishwasher, and lots of natural light. The available bedroom is $860/month and has a window, a skylight, a mirrored closet and carpet floors. It's about 11 x 17 ft.\n\nWe share utilities, which average to about $60/month (we have Comcast internet and TV, and also pay for PG\u0026E and water). There is a coin-operated washer and dryer for laundry downstairs (shared by the four units); it's $1.25 to wash, $1.25 to dry. The house also has access to a bike rack and outdoor patio with some seating and a barbecue. Our landlord is responsive and takes great care of the place, including landscaping and addressing maintenance issues if they arise. We're all pretty clean, and it's been easy to keep the bathrooms and common areas nice -- we share the costs of trash bags, toilet paper, etc. (which usually isn't much; when someone buys something for the house, they mark it on our spreadsheet so it is incorporated into the rent).\n\nOne last note: Sorry, but we can only have one person in the room, and aren't able to have cats or dogs in the house. Also, smoking is not allowed in the house.\n\nThe parking situation:\nIf you have a car, there's free parking on one side of MLK (excluding one street sweeping day per month), though it's a good idea to get a parking permit with the city for $55/year to be able to park anywhere in this part of town (you'd just need to re-register your car to this address).\n\nYou'd be joining four awesome housemates: \n\nLouis is a 4th year PhD student at Cal. A native Midwesterner and adopted East Coaster before heading west, he is still amazed by the number of hikes within 2 hours of Berkeley. Officially, he's training to be an environmental and energy economist. Unofficially, he's an avid foodie, an amateur pianist, an up-and-coming runner, and a recovering night owl.\n\nDaniel is a 5th year PhD Student at Cal, who moved to Berkeley from Australia, although most folks think he sounds British (including some Australians). He loves reading, exercising, singing and coffee. He is indifferent to vegemite.\n\nAndrea is an Architectural Designer, working towards becoming a full-blown Architect. She is originally from Sacramento and loves sports of any kind, preferring to play them rather than watch them. She also loves to cook, hike, bike, ski, kayak, creative projects, laugh and likes to keep things clean and organized.\n\nHarrison is a jovial fellow who is fiercely proud of both his Bostonian and Greek heritages. He drives his car for Lyft whilst planning new travel adventures, and career moves. He also enjoys food, discussing politics, religion, and pretty much anything you want to talk about. He's an inquisitive soul.\n\nWe're all pretty low-key and maintain an easy-going environment in our house; people do their own thing, but we're all friendly and chat when we're cooking/hanging out/watching TV in the kitchen/common area. People are also always welcome to have friends over for dinner, to hang out, etc. Please feel free to contact us with any questions, or to set up a time to stop by the house.\n",

The colors are a warm off-white cream with pinewood trim. The canopy covered outdoor patio, accessed through double French Doors, leads out into the sunny backyard, with citrus, peach, and plum trees as well as other green fauna and trees waiting to be planted. We are communal in that we share the backyard areas; good communication is a must, so friendliness and a sense of humor go a long way! \n\nApproximately 400 sq feet inside, there is a full sized kitchen that includes a gas stove, dishwasher, refrigerator, microwave, and lots of pantry and cabinet storage. The bathroom has a large shower stall and is fully tiled with a glass block window for plenty of natural light and privacy. The outside patio is tiled and adds an extra 130 sq feet of outdoor living ability.\n\nSEMI-FURNISHED with a folding table attached to the wrap-around built-in bookshelves, a queen bed, a hand built redwood bed base with more under bed storage, a small dresser of drawers and a corner shower caddy. If you have a bunch of furniture, this won't work.\n\nLocated between the Redwood and Laurel districts, this is a quiet street with great neighbors. Even while having quick access to all freeways, easy shopping and restaurants, there is a lot of privacy in this situation and it is very quiet as far as any freeway noise. \n\nJust minutes away from the Diamond, Joaquin Miller and Redwood parks, and all the fabulous redwood trails therein, there is quick access to the Colleges of Merritt, Mills and Holy Names.\n\nWith a short walk to the 35th or MacArthur Avenues, there is a great commute to SF via express bus or carpool, or to catch the main AC bus lines to BART, San Francisco, Berkeley, or downtown Oakland. \n\n\u0009Monthly rental fee is $1600, including utilities\n(Rent includes these utilities: AT\u0026T Internet, PG\u0026E, EBMUD and WasteManagement) \n\u0009MOVE IN is $3200 (first month's rent and 1/2 of Security Deposit).\n\u0009Total Security Deposit is $3200; \n(The second half of the Security Deposit can be paid in incremental amounts over time)\n\u0009References, Proof of Income and Credit Report required.\n\u0009No section eight\u0009\n\u0009No smoking-No illicit drugs \n\u0009No extra storage on the property \n\u0009Street parking only\n\nWe want someone who is responsible and pays rent on time. Willingness to set up an electronic bank transfer is essential. Again; references, proof of 3 months of income and current credit report required. No prior evictions.\n\nAVAILABLE April 1st, 2016 (possibly earlier)\n\nPLEASE NOTE: The pictures here are not all correct as far as furniture (the chairs and the small orange couch..and the cat..are gone...and the outside patio is open now, and the yard is still in fluxuation). We are still processing and cleaning and preparing this unit, but the pictures give an approximate visual idea. Newer pictures will be re-posted as soon as I have them ready. \n\nIf interested, contact me and tell me about yourself and what you are looking for. We can set up an appointment.\n",
