One bedroom available in a 2 bedroom/1 bath apartment in beautiful Elmwood (at College and Woolsey) starting April 1. This cheerful apartment gets lots of light and is set back from the street, so it's pretty quiet. It has a gas stove, hardwood floors, and washer and dryer. The bedroom can come furnished (full bed, dresser, nightstand, and lamp - see pictures) or not. It's about a 10 minute walk to Rockridge Bart and a 20 minute walk to the Berkeley campus (and the 51B runs along College). Safeway is a 5 minute walk away and Trader Joe's and Whole Foods are about 10, and it's a quick walk to all the charming Elmwood and Rockridge shops and restaurants. I'm a law student at Berkeley in my late-20s. I spend a lot of time studying, so I'm hoping to find someone that's pretty quiet and clean - but friendly too! Rent is $1350/mo (with a $1350 security deposit), and $35 application fee.

If you're interested, send me an email with a little about yourself and we can set up a time to meet and for you to take a look at the place.

Hi:
We are thinking of moving into a bigger place in March. 
This apartment unit is in Hillside Village (Shattuck Ave and Delaware street), it's on the 4th floor (total of 5, and is facing east, so facing the campus which is quieter compare to west facing units that are facing Shattuck Ave. 
You can go to www.hillsidevillageberkeley.com for more details about the apartment complex.
Management is responsive, and the apartment complex is very convenient to BART, the university, and many great restaurants and cafe. It's also great to have the leasing office to handle your package for you when you are not home. The lease can start in March, and ends on July 31st, 2016. You can then decide if you want to renew it or not.

Please let me know if you are interested, or if you want to see more photos. It will be unfurnished so you will need your own furnitures. Thanks

I am looking for one mature and reliable person to live in my adorable studio. There is a private bathroom, pull out love seat, a natural gas fire pit in the yard, a storage shed, a gas grill, and a few fruit trees. There is a kitchenette with a nice double induction burner, blender/food processor, induction kettle, microwave, convection oven, plenty of storage space,and mini-fridge. The room is fully furnished with queen bed, pillows, desk and chair, heater, sheets, towels, and kitchen supplies (including some staples like spices, rice, four, oil, etc). I will even consider letting you use my bike if you are trustworthy. The place is really cute with lots of light. The neighborhood is very quiet. There is a great park 2 blocks away and many groceries, coffee shops, laundromats, bars, and restaurants within walking distance. There is a bus at the end of the street that gets you right onto campus within 15 minutes or you can bike there in 15 minutes. You have a pretty great view of the city from the top of the driveway as this neighborhood is up on a hill. Landlord is fine with guests as long as you let her know.

The move in/out dates are semi-negotiable but you would have to be out by August 21st at the latest. $500 deposit (refundable assuming no damage). Rent includes all utilities. No pets - sorry. 

There are a few odd things about the place. The cottage is a mother-in-law suite - as in: it is in the backyard of the main house where the landlord and her 2 children live. The bathroom that goes with the cottage is connected to the back of the main house. It is a private bathroom with only one entrance from the outside which is about ten steps outside the front door of the cottage. So you have to walk outside to get to the bathroom, but not far, and it is your bathroom alone. Also - there is no sink in the studio so you have to do dishes in the bathroom sink. I have a dish drainer setup in the bathroom and the sink is not prohibitively small. While this is a strange setup, I have never had issues with it at all.

The landlord will want to meet you but other than that you won't interact with her much. You basically have 100% privacy in the unit and backyard and it is nice and quiet.

; A cozy good size studio 2 blocks from Downtown Point Richmond on a quite street.


If you want a modern place may be this one is not for you . . . but, if you yearn for a Victorian sunny habitat with view from above and high ceiling . . .

located 2 blocks from downtown Point Richmond. Quiet, upscale residential neighborhood. A short walk to restaurants, bars, shopping, public library, post office, banks etc. It also has one of the best closed heated swimming pools in the country, many parks, trails, historic sight and one of the best views of the bay, swimming beach all in walking distance.

A bright, sunny end unit with a private deck. . Features a kitchen with cupboard/closets space, gas stove & full size refrigerator. Washer Dryer on-site.

Gas cooking, cold and hot water, and garbage are included (tenant pays for electricity only). A large ""community"" back yard/deck with a little garden which gets afternoon sun; a good place for sun-bathing and barbecuing. On-site laundry facility and ample street parking are available.

Located in a quite upscale residential neighborhood just one short block from charming Point Richmond downtown with some 30 restaurants, couple of coffee shops (yes, Starbucks too) couple of fancy, but law cost restaurant bars just like in the City of San Francisco (other than the cost . . .)

Point Richmond is as safe as it gets: For the past 30 years there has been no shooting out in the streets EVER in point Richmond.

HIDDEN GEM: The people of Point Richmond are very serious about keeping it upscale, quiet and friendly. It has everything that Sausalito and Tiburon across the bay have, just better: The heel is more beautiful, ask the painters who come to Point Richmond to paint scenery that they sell all over the world, and not there. The air is better, cleaner. There are four park, swimming beach, one of the best swimming pools, and a golf course that Sausalito and Tiburon do not have! Only the price is lower, but you get so much more, if you care for little fun without the tourists noise!

A few minutes drive from Berkeley . . .The unit has good accessibility to the East Bay, San Francisco and the North Bay with minutes to BART Bay Bridge, HWs 80, 580, 101, Richmond/San Rafael Bridge and Richmond Ferry Terminal. There is one park 2 blocks away and additional two parks and a beach for swimming within walking distance (300 yards). The building is surrounded by charming hiking/walking trails with a view of the bay.

please watch short videos which gives a little view of the many restaurants, coffee shops, attractions of Point Richmond:

Renters are facing really difficult times right now with very high rent, crazy security deposits, no pets being accepted and landlords want you to have perfect credit and income 3 times or 4 higher than the rent just to allow you to rent their house and pay it off for them. Then they want to increase the rent every time the lease it up and in many cases ask you to move so they can sell the house or move back into it. 

We can send you all of the program information in writing just by sending a request. it includes all of our licensing information. You can call Lynne Duban the Finance Director at

to qualify as long as you have a 580 or higher credit score and can document your income. We get so many people who worry this is a scam but everything we provide you is verifiable through multiple governmental sources.

I have sold homes from Berkeley to Discovery Bay for 27 years. I have managed special financing programs provided by the State and Federal Government that encourage renters to become home owners by providing financing options that don't require perfect credit and in most cases cost less to get into than a rental these days. The financing is 30 year fixed rate and includes property taxes, and all the insurance. Simply put, people who bought homes 15 years ago are still paying the same payment they had originally and you will have the same payment 15 years after you buy the house. Landlords will obviously not be keeping the rent at the same level.

In addition there are tax benefits that you get as a homeowner that help most people save thousands per year in Income Tax. This is the part where many people start to think this is a scam or baloney in general. To help with that we offer two things. I am going to give you ways to confirm the information. In addition I can send you an e mail that has both detailed breakdowns on the programs as well as an e mail that has the properties available with pictures and details. 

The programs that we utilize are FHA, VA, USDA Guaranteed, we also use CHDAP California Housing Down Payment Assistance Program, and CHFA California Housing Finance Agency. These last two programs are state based and provide almost 100% of the down payment you need for the FHA Loan. USDA and VA don't require any down payment. 

This house in Discovery Bay is just 1 of 57 available in Brentwood and Discovery Bay. It offers 3 Bedrooms, 2 1/2 Bathrooms and over 2000 square feet and is in beautiful condition. Its on a 9000 square foot lot with a 2 car attached garage and side access right near the lake.

The other 56 houses range in size from 1,000-3900 square feet and 2-5 bedrooms. The monthly payments range from $1950-$3400. 

The cost to move into one of the homes will typically be $3,000-$5,000. Your first payment will not be due until 30 days after you move in. 

To qualify you will need the following minimum qualifications
A credit score that is 580 or higher (You can check your score at credit karma if you aren't sure)
Proof of income in the form of 30 days paystubs and the last 2 tax returns
No Short Sale Bankruptcy or Foreclosure in the last 3 years

Eric Wexelman Licensed by the California Department of Real Estate. Texts and E mails are responded to fastest as I can't answer the phone when I am with other clients. I WILL SEND YOU A FULL BREAKDOWN ON THE PROGRAMS AND HOW TO QUALIFY AND ALL THE PROPERTIES INCLUDING PICTURES AND DETAILS IF YOU TELL ME WHICH CITIES YOU ARE INTERESTED IN.

This is an amazing large studio with hardwood floor on the 3rd floor. We have a park like backyard and parking. In short, I don't think you could find a better studio with everything that this has for $1700. The first open houses will be on Monday 22nd at 12pm & 6pm. Please meet outside. If I'm not there I'm probably showing the unit and will be back down in a few.
  540 Alcatraz avenue just down from Telegraph ave.
  This building was built in 1929. It has a large entryway with two closets. The living room is huge with large windows facing the hills. The living room has great 1920's wall mounted light fixtures and has a large walk in closet. The kitchen is big as well and has enough room for a good sized table near the windows in the dining area of the kitchen. There is no dishwasher or garbage disposal. The bathroom has a pedestal sink and tile floors.

 We have parking in our fenced in backyard for $65 or under the building for $80. Deposit is $500. No cat or dogs. We also have a giant back yard. It's like a small park back there and there is additional space where people have gardens. There is a laundry room in the basement with four washers and four dryers. The machines are coin operated. There's a bit of bike storage down there as well.  The heat is steam and we pay for that as well as water and garbage. Nice savings there. The lease is one year which turns into month to month. You really have to check this out. 

You can also check out the you tube video of a studio. The video also shows the building and the grounds.

We will have applications at the open house. If you have something put together already you can put it with our application in case yours doesn't have something that ours needs.
We do need to run a credit check through National Tenant Network and that will cost $15 per adult. There is no other application fee. We would like to have a check for the fee since we do not carry change while showing apartments.
We take applications and then choose based mainly on income and credit. Our application asks for the addresses and contact info for the last three apartments, employment info and contacts, other forms of income, large loan payment basic info such as car loans, your phone number and email, etc. This is just in case you want to save some time for yourself and have these things ready with copies that you can drop off at whatever open house you go to.

Complete and tasteful full house renovation (2016 craftsman in a Great 100 year old neighborhood 3 minute walk to Ashby BART, Berkeley Bowl, 5 Cafe's, playhouse, library, tools library, Biodiesel station, 3 parks and more.

This is a clean, non cluttered house. 

One of the biggest draws is our proximity to the closest BART station to San Francisco in Berkeley (1100 feet - 4 minute walk). There are only 3 stops before you get to the first stop in SF (Embarcadero). It takes 18 minutes to get to San Francisco. You literally DON'T need a car. You can walk or bike to Berkeley Bowl (Berkeley equivalent to Whole Foods but better prices and fruit / veggie selection), Walgreens, 5 cafes, 3 corner stores, art galleries and much more. You are literally in the ""center"" of Berkeley (from our perspective).

The house was completely renovated from Oct 15-Jan 16 (last month):
BEDROOMS: See below for detailed explanation. ALL PILLOWS AND DOWN COMFORTERS AND OF COURSE SHEETS ARE WASHED BEFORE A NEW PARTY ARRIVES
PLUMBING: New on demand water heater and plumbing (great pressure) to allow all 4 bathrooms, the dishwasher and washing machine to run at once with unlimited hot water. You can literally take a 2 hour shower if you want
4 SHOWERS: Granite and tile 
KITCHEN: Brand new kitchen with 8 foot slider to awesome deck leading to backyard. All new high end appliances, 5 burner stove, dishwasher, microwave, sink, fridge and large stackable washer dryer
WHOLE HOUSE INSIDE AND OUTSIDE:: Painted 2 weeks ago, brand new double paned windows, digital entry locks (reset for each guest). Large stackable washer dryer in unit on main floor.
BACKYARD: Bonfire. Huge back yard with brand new 9 foot redwood fence / bamboo surrounding property and organic vegetable garden you can eat from. Water fountain. Teak tables with heat lamps and umbrellas to seat 16 if needed. High chairs and boosters included
INGROUND HOT TUB: will be complete may 15


NEIGHBORS: We live next door in a 3 story craftsman and are the most chill family you'll ever meet - if you decide you want to :) We are not nosy - you'll probably never see us. We don't care if you have parties (no keg stands), there is no curfew (the area has huge lots so no one cares if you make a little noise or have a bonfire. We are one of the neighbors and the other side are the most mellow people in the world.

This 2-level detached townhouse has no shared walls and no neighbors above or below. High ceiling heights, modern architectural elements, and expansive windows and skylight give this 1 bedroom plus den, 1 bathroom unit, an abundance of natural light.

This loft-style home is spacious, with an open living, dining, and work space. A beautiful open kitchen offers granite countertops, bamboo cabinetry, and top-of-the-line stainless steel Bosch appliances including a refrigerator, dishwasher, microwave, gas oven/range, Nest Thermostat, and garbage disposal. The straight staircase leads to the spacious second floor with one bedroom, a large walk-in closet, a den, and a good-sized bathroom with 2 wall-mounted Duravit sinks + custom built vanities, a tiled shower/bathtub, and high-grade lighting fixtures.

Designed by the award-winning firm David Baker + Partners, the individual townhouses at West End Commons combine the functional and stylish aspects of a loft with more traditional aspects of home design. Large open floor plans are paired with well-appointed kitchens and bathrooms as well as more secluded sleeping areas on the upper floors. Each of the townhouses opens on to 1 of 5 lanes. Lined with pavers, lit by streetlights, and landscaped with trees, vines, and grasses, the lanes create an intimate retreat that was inspired by classic urban neighborhoods such as Brooklyn Heights, London's Islington, and Boston's North End. A path leading through shared green space provides an inviting place to wander or meet up with friends, neighbors, or clients.

Located in Oakland's West Clawson neighborhood just 2 blocks south of Emeryville, the development has easy access to all of Emeryville's shops, eateries, grocery stores, and entertainment.

Renters are facing really difficult times right now with very high rent, crazy security deposits, no pets being accepted and landlords want you to have perfect credit and income 3 times or 4 higher than the rent just to allow you to rent their house and pay it off for them. Then they want to increase the rent every time the lease it up and in many cases ask you to move so they can sell the house or move back into it. 

We can send you all of the program information in writing just by sending a request. it includes all of our licensing information. Most people qualify when they have a 580 or higher credit score and can document your income. We get so many people who worry this is a scam but everything we provide you is verifiable through multiple governmental sources.

I have sold homes from Berkeley to Discovery Bay for 27 years. I have managed special financing programs provided by the State and Federal Government that encourage renters to become home owners by providing financing options that don't require perfect credit and in most cases cost less to get into than a rental these days. The financing is 30 year fixed rate and includes property taxes, and all the insurance. Simply put, people who bought homes 15 years ago are still paying the same payment they had originally and you will have the same payment 15 years after you buy the house. Landlords will obviously not be keeping the rent at the same level.

In addition there are tax benefits that you get as a homeowner that help most people save thousands per year in Income Tax. This is the part where many people start to think this is a scam or baloney in general. To help with that we offer two things. I am going to give you ways to confirm the information. In addition I can send you an e mail that has both detailed breakdowns on the programs as well as an e mail that has the properties available with pictures and details. 

The programs that we utilize are FHA, VA, USDA Guaranteed, we also use CHDAP California Housing Down Payment Assistance Program, and CHFA California Housing Finance Agency. These last two programs are state based and provide almost 100% of the down payment you need for the FHA Loan. USDA and VA don't require any down payment. 

This is just 1 of the homes that are available in San Leandro, Hayward, San Lorenzo and Oakland. THERE IS AN E MAIL LIST AVAILABLE THAT GIVES YOU ALL THE DETAILS OF THE PROGRAM AND THE INSTRUCTIONS TO GET QUALIFIED AS WELL AS PICTURES AND DETAILS OF ALL THE HOUSES. PLEASE TEXT OR E MAIL THE REQUEST WITH YOUR E MAIL ADDRESS SO I CAN SEND THESE TO YOU.

This home in San Leandro is 4 bedrooms 2 bathrooms and 1750 square feet. It has a 1 car attached garage and this is all on a lot that is almost 4,000 square feet. 

There are 50 homes available from $2175-$3400 and the homes are 760-2200 square feet with 1-5 bedrooms. There are also Condominiums and Townhomes that have payments ranging from $1625-$2720 per month with 1-4 bedrooms and 680-1700 square feet. These properties will have a separate Home Owners Association due per month of $200-$430 per month. 

The cost to move into one of the homes will typically be $3,000-$5,000. Your first payment will not be due until 30 days after you move in.

To qualify you must have at least
1. A credit score of 580 or higher (credit karma is a place to check if you aren't sure of your credit score)
2. You will need to prove your income with the last 30 days paystubs and the last 2 years tax returns
3. No Bankruptcy in the last 2 years
4. No Short Sale, or Foreclosure in the last 3 years.

Property & Unit Description

Ellsworth Apartments
2312 Ellsworth Street
Berkeley CA 94704 

The Ellsworth Building has approximately 20 apartments and is located just ½ blocks from the UC Berkley Campus. The building consists of 2 separate complexes both of which have studios, 1 & 2 bedroom apartments. Although the apartment buildings are super close to the UC Berkeley campus, cafes, bookstores, parking garages and the Edward Dome Stadium, the apartment building is quiet and peaceful nestled far away from the street towards the back of the property. Tenants experience a great deal of privacy living in ""The Ellsworth Building"" although they are minutes to the University.

Currently we have a lovely studio apartment as close to UC Berkley as you can get. If you want convenience and the ability to walk to class within 5 minutes, this is the apartment for you!

Neighborhood Information

Directly across the street many students, visitors and the San Francisco Bay Area community are entertained by Cal Performances located in the well know ""Zellarbach Auditorium"".

when we were looking for a place we initially wanted to be on a main street.. 

piedmont, grand, college (both berkeley and oakland), bay st, fourth st, university, you get the idea. . . 

but we couldn't figure out which... 
and we didn't know what that would mean for parking... 
and we weren't sure how close that would put us to highways if we need to leave town :) 

so... 
we wrote down every place we like in the east bay... 
Including. . . 

http://www.4thstreetshop.com/ 
shopping outdoors 
http://www.sfgate.com/traveler/guide/eastbay/neighborhoods/piedmont.shtml 
restaurants & independent movies 
http://www.baystreetemeryville.com/ 
commercial/mall like & mainstream movies 
http://www.shattuckshop.com/ 
decent coffee shops and various ethnic foods 
http://www.sfgate.com/traveler/guide/eastbay/neighborhoods/grand.shtml 
a lake, a farmers market, a theatre, delis, bakeries, and both starbucks for her, petes for me 
http://www.shopparkstreet.com/ 
a little further out in alameda, a longer stretch that used to be trees and is now everything else 
http://www.oaklandchinatownchamber.org/visitor/about_chinatown.html 
smaller, but more authentic then sf chinatown 
http://jacklondonsquare.com/ 
shopping, dining, jazz, waterfront 

and PUT IT ON A MAP... Just like this... 
https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=zaby4TO8AqUY.kK5QINPCDDg4&usp=sharing

and then we picked the center of it all... 
ADELINE ST, EMERYVILLE 

And 80, 580, 880, 980, 24, 13, etc are all very very accessible... 

so now we're close to everything we want, 
we can eat, play, sleep, read a book, see a movie, go to the park, go to berkeley bowl, go to university of berkeley, etc. 
we can get on a highway that takes us to SF in 10 minutes, 
we can leave behind the car at the ashby bart if we want to be good to the environment, 
we have a place to park (secured on our lot) 
we have a washer and dryer (secured - no coins) 
we have internet access 
we have utilities 


FAQ 

availability - place just got posted, is available, but we got more responds then we expected, so pardon the generic reply: 

showing the unit - we will look at applications this week, show the unit the week of 01/11. earliest move-in will be 02/01, though 03/01 is preferable.

kids - ok to have kids, there are schools, and a childrens hospital in the area 

supermarkets - plenty in the area... from shop n save, to safeway, to berkeley bowl, to whole foods 

layout - see picture below 

price - there's a 1BR 4 blocks away renting for 2500 - in fact, looking at 3900 Adeline, which is closer to best buy/ikea and highway noise, but further from UC Berkeley, Oakland down to Alameda, and you'll see STUDIOs renting for $1775 (not to mention parking) - look at the pricing in all of emeryville, and you find that it's already priced to rent. the market is hot, but we want a long term tenant so it's priced fairly.

those who travel alot - you can leave your car and disappear whenever you'd like, just give us a notice so we don't worry about you 

check scams - no interest in cashing checks ahead of time and giving you the difference. 

delayed rental - looking to rent asap. not sure we could guarantee the place for anything more than a month delay, and only to the right candidate, with a deposit, and the other general warnings 

out of towners - no problem if you're relocating, and feel free to ask questions... again, if there's a delay in move, please make sure to communicate it early and see the above line 

move in costs - unless you're a terrible person, with terrible credit, and a terrible attitude, first+last month will be sufficient. 

DISHWASHER - YES, UPDATING THE POST TO REFLECT THAT TOO... THANKS FOR REMINDING US. 

anything else that was neglected in the posting - feel free to ask

This unit is under 700 sqft. We had an earlier posting for a similar (slightly smaller) property down the street. That unit was rented out one day after posting and went for over asking, 6 months paid in advance. This location and price point are not going to be matched. We are looking for good long term tenants. Please allow 48 hours for responses.

My roommate is graduating in May and my boyfriend and I are looking for a replacement. The apartment is a two bedroom-one bath on Spruce street (5 min walk to campus, 8 min walk to bart). We are sharing a double in the apartment and looking for someone to take the single bedroom. Utilities (just cable and PG&E) usually comes to about $30 a month. Parking spot available, coin-operated washer and dryer on site, hard wood floors, and is completely furnished. The lease is from May 2016-May 2017. Pets are negotiable.
A little about us: We are both UC Berkeley students in our twenties and very stable (no drama or rent issues). He's studying Chemical Engineering and I'm studying Integrative Biology. We are both really studious and when we have free time we like to watch Netflix, cook awesome meals, explore SF/East bay, and go on runs/to the gym. We tend to be home bodies but the room we share is pretty big so you'll have your space. 
Looking for: Someone who is laid back, respectful, and relatively clean.
Lease renewal is due soon so we are looking for someone who can sign soon. 
If you're interested, we can set up a visit and discuss details further. Thanks!

Life on a boat is a very peaceful experience, but you are also centered next to everything here. It is truly the best of both worlds. You have complete access to Oakland, Berkeley, and SF with the serenity of a park-like atmosphere. The Marina has picnic and BBQ areas for you to enjoy year round.

When you are not enjoying the spectacular views of the bay, enjoy touring around Oakland, Berkeley and San Francisco! There is also a kitchenette with a hotplate skillet, toaster oven, refrigerator, microwave, electric water kettle, and hand pumped water. Elegant lighting and curtains give a cozy feel in your home away from home. There is a twin sized bed and functioning toilet. On the back deck there is a small Weber gas grill.

Private bath house and laundry facility with wifi and tv on the premises.

I will respect your privacy, but I am on call if you need anything

Location, Location, Location! 

This place is magical. The views of the Golden Gate Bridge and the skyline of San Francisco at sunset are breathtaking. People come here just to take photos at sunset. Emeryville is the center of the bay. There is an outdoor mall and shopping center within walking distance, and there is also a FREE SHUTTLE that will take you to these places. The mall has everything from the Apple Store to Old Navy and an AMC theater. Guitar Center, Trader Joe's and Bev Mo are just around the corner as well. If you want to get into the city of San Francisco, we are located right across the bay and have what I call a private driveway into the city, as the on ramp to the Bay Bridge is just at the end of the marina.

Public transit is free! The Emery-go-Round is a shuttle that comes every 15 minutes and will take you to the local shops and BART.

The wifi is spotty. It works ok, but I use a range extending antenna and that gives me no problems. Amped wireless is the brand name.

You have complete access to all parts of the boat, however, I do ask that you refrain from operating any valves, rigging, or the motor.

I only ask that you respect the boat and all her inner workings. The toilet is does not accept solid waste, but there is a Private Bath house with large showers and a laundry room with a TV and WiFi. This is a private marina so please respect the guests and residents here by keeping down the noise levels. Also, you will need access keys that I will provide. You will be responsible for lost keys at the rate of $100 per key. Thank you. Happy House Hunting!

Complete and tasteful full house renovation (2016 craftsman in a Great 100 year old neighborhood 3 minute walk to Ashby BART, Berkeley Bowl, 5 Cafe's, playhouse, library, tools library, Biodiesel station, 3 parks and more.

This is a clean, non cluttered house. 

One of the biggest draws is our proximity to the closest BART station to San Francisco in Berkeley (1100 feet - 4 minute walk). There are only 3 stops before you get to the first stop in SF (Embarcadero). It takes 18 minutes to get to San Francisco. You literally DON'T need a car. You can walk or bike to Berkeley Bowl (Berkeley equivalent to Whole Foods but better prices and fruit / veggie selection), Walgreens, 5 cafes, 3 corner stores, art galleries and much more. You are literally in the ""center"" of Berkeley (from our perspective).

The house was completely renovated from Oct 15-Jan 16 (last month):
BEDROOMS: See below for detailed explanation. ALL PILLOWS AND DOWN COMFORTERS AND OF COURSE SHEETS ARE WASHED BEFORE A NEW PARTY ARRIVES
PLUMBING: New on demand water heater and plumbing (great pressure) to allow all 4 bathrooms, the dishwasher and washing machine to run at once with unlimited hot water. You can literally take a 2 hour shower if you want
4 SHOWERS: Granite and tile 
KITCHEN: Brand new kitchen with 8 foot slider to awesome deck leading to backyard. All new high end appliances, 5 burner stove, dishwasher, microwave, sink, fridge and large stackable washer dryer
WHOLE HOUSE INSIDE AND OUTSIDE:: Painted 2 weeks ago, brand new double paned windows, digital entry locks (reset for each guest). Large stackable washer dryer in unit on main floor.
BACKYARD: Bonfire. Huge back yard with brand new 9 foot redwood fence / bamboo surrounding property and organic vegetable garden you can eat from. Water fountain. Teak tables with heat lamps and umbrellas to seat 16 if needed. High chairs and boosters included
INGROUND HOT TUB: will be complete may 15


NEIGHBORS: We live next door in a 3 story craftsman and are the most chill family you'll ever meet - if you decide you want to :) We are not nosy - you'll probably never see us. We don't care if you have parties (no keg stands), there is no curfew (the area has huge lots so no one cares if you make a little noise or have a bonfire. We are one of the neighbors and the other side are the most mellow people in the world.

Located in the up-and-coming West Oakland Arts and Crafts District, this 1907 vintage, TWO-bedroom/one bath, UPSTAIRS apartment offers nine-foot high ceilings, BRAND NEW fresh white paint and wall-to-wall, BRAND NEW short-pile, industrial taupe carpeting. 

It is in a freestanding building with four identical two-bedroom apartments, two upstairs and two downstairs. Street parking is easy and ample. 

(IF YOU SEE THIS POSTING, THE APARTMENT IS STILL AVAILABLE. IT WILL NOT BE RENTED UNTIL THE CONCLUSION OF THE OPEN-HOUSE ON SUNDAY, MARCH 6, FROM 11:00AM-1:00 PM ------ I'M SORRY, I AM NOT AVAILABLE TO SHOW THE UNIT BEFORE THE OPEN-HOUSE ON SUNDAY) 

We've completely renovated the kitchen with a BRAND NEW refrigerator, BRAND-NEW over-the-stove microwave, BRAND NEW kitchen cabinets and BRAND NEW kitchen sink and faucet. 

The bathroom has also been COMPLETELY RENOVATED with a BRAND NEW toilet, BRAND NEW bathtub/shower, and BRAND NEW European-style bathroom sink fixture. The bathroom also offers BRAND NEW cabinets and BRAND NEW floor tile. 

There is a nice laundry room on the premises with a coin-op washer and dryer. 

There is a cute, beautifully landscaped backyard with a patio for hanging out, BBQing or entertaining. Each of the four units also gets it's own weather-tight outdoor storage locker, located in the backyard. 

The yard is completely enclosed and fenced to keep intruders out and pets from wandering off. It is a pooch paradise! There is a redwood community table that seats up to 10 for a dinner party. . . If you like to garden, there is an area for you to plant vegetables or flowers...

Located just off West Grand Ave. near Adeline, this building is literally a five-minute, straight-shot drive to the Bay Bridge tollbooth!!! It's a five-minute drive to 880 and 580 onramps. 10 minutes to Emeryville, Berkeley or Downtown Oakland. Ten minutes to Ikea, Trader Joe's, Safeway Pak-And-Save, Nordstrom Rack, Bay Street Mall, Home Depot, Lanesplitter Pizza, Target, Best Buy! Very central and convenient... 

The neighborhood is mixed-use with lofts, warehouses, art-spaces and various industrial workshops, etc. There are also lots of old Victorian houses in various stages of rehab, some gorgeous and some run-down. There is a new charter school (Vincent Academy) 1/2 block away. 

Crime in this neighborhood is mostly a thing of the past, with West Oakland's serious revitalization program underway. New development and creative people are flooding in from Berkeley and San Francisco and have turned this area into a neighborhood for artists, musicians and craftspersons. However it IS an urban neighborhood and can get very noisy sometimes... It's not Piedmont! Locals are sometimes hanging out on the corner, socializing and playing music. It can be like Mardi Gras at times. If you crave quiet and serenity, this may not be the neighborhood for you. It is a VERY friendly neighborhood, but can sometimes be noisy in the daytimes.

The building has a security fence around the perimeter, a security gate at the front entry door and each of the four apartment doors are individually gated, so tenants are SUPER SAFE. We have never had a break-in, or any problem with crime in this building. Nobody has ever been hassled in the 8 years I've owned this building. The neighbors are nice.

A cat or nice dog MAY be OK with a reasonable pet deposit. (Deposit amount dependent on the pet) 

The apartment rent is $1800/month. SORRY, NO SECTION 8 ACCEPTED. 

$1800 refundable security deposit to move in. One UPSTAIRS apartment is available NOW! 

Tenant pays PGE gas and electric. Owner pays water and trash. 

I'll be showing the apartment SUNDAY, March 6, FROM 11:00am - 1:00PM

Please come by during those hours to view the place and meet me... The address is 1084 24th St. Oakland CA 94607. (Major cross-streets are West Grand and Adeline) 

Applications will be available at the time of the showing, or you may bring a renters resume. Pay stubs and/or credit reports are also welcome, but not mandatory for consideration.

Applications are paper or pdf only, available at the end of the viewing.
All applicants over 18 need to fill out an application and provide a $40 application fee in cashier's check or money order payable to Picardo Arms Apartments.There is a $100 holding deposit. We only process one person's or one set of roommates' applications at a time. The deposit takes the apartment off the market and is refundable for up to three business days. After that, it's non-refundable. Bring all of your documents at the same time, and we process your application well within the three days. If you pass, the deposit becomes the first $100 of your security deposit. If you don't pass, even if your application is processed after the three business days, we return the $100 to you. The $40 application fees are non-refundable once the applications are processed regardless of the result.Applicants must show combined income of at least 3x the rent amount per month gross (pre-tax) and good credit based in the U.S. If credit and income aren't met (and the applicant does not have overly poor credit) then a cosigner may be used. A cosigner applies in the same way with another $40 application fee. A copy of a passport or driver's license and proof of income is required for each application. Proof of income can be in the form of two recent pay stubs, social security checks, pension, trust fund or support checks, or tax returns.
Note for new international residents: if you don't have a credit history in the U.S. because of your national status, you may be exempt from the credit requirement; however, you will still need to meet the income requirement and will be required to pay an increased security desposit.
All fees and charges, including move in fees, must be in the form of cashier's check or money order, payable to Picardo Arms. Once you are a tenant, from your 2nd month onward, you may pay by personal check.

This one bedroom apartment is a cozy, quiet escape from the busyness of Berkeley. With high vaulted wood beam ceilings, a skylight, and a small wood-burning fireplace, this residence feels like a cabin. It has one spacious bedroom (including two large closets), one bathroom, a large living room, and a charming kitchen, making this apartment perfect for one resident. The apartment itself is tucked off the street, mitigating traffic noise. It has a small side yard, and is surrounded by large trees (redwoods) which keep the apartment cool through the summer. Its location is just off Ashby Ave, right near it's intersection with College Ave. It is close to public transportation, with the 51B stop at College and Ashby being on the same block. Also, as it is right off of College Ave, this apartment is no more than a five minute walk from a bakery, Elmwood Cafe, Ici's, La Med, and other great restaurants and small businesses.

Per the landlord's request, this is a non-smoking apartment, with no pets allowed.

I will be showing the place Friday (March 4th) from 11:30am - 2pm, or Sunday (March 6th) from 3pm-5pm. Please feel free to email me to let me know you are coming, and I will send you the address. When you get here, the apartment is tucked behind a large wood-shingled house. Just walk down the driveway (the driveway to the left of the house if you are facing it) and once you see the carport, turn right. The apartment door will be open.

The basics:
*Room available for $860 in 5-bedroom, 2-bathroom unit
*Northwest of campus at MLK Jr. Way & Francisco St.
*Available April 1st
*Gender balance: 2 girls, 3 guys

The location:
We're in a 5-bedroom, 2-bathroom unit in a big Victorian-looking house (the house is divided into four separate units) in downtown/north Berkeley. It's a great location: three blocks/5-minute walk from University Ave. (including bus lines and Trader Joe's); a 10-minute walk to downtown Berkeley BART and west campus (along Oxford St.); and a 10-minute walk to the Gourmet Ghetto (Cheeseboard, Andronico's, Safeway, etc.).

The street is residential and the neighborhood is very nice to walk around. Besides being close to North Shattuck and University Ave., we're also a couple blocks from the Ohlone Greenway (at Hearst and MLK) and about half a mile to the track at Martin Luther King Middle School (at Hopkins and MLK).

The place:
We have the entire top (third) floor of the house, which includes five good size bedrooms, two big bathrooms, and a kitchen/common area with hardwood floor, a dishwasher, and lots of natural light. The available bedroom is $860/month and has a window, a skylight, a mirrored closet and carpet floors. It's about 11 x 17 ft.

We share utilities, which average to about $60/month (we have Comcast internet and TV, and also pay for PG&E and water). There is a coin-operated washer and dryer for laundry downstairs (shared by the four units); it's $1.25 to wash, $1.25 to dry. The house also has access to a bike rack and outdoor patio with some seating and a barbecue. Our landlord is responsive and takes great care of the place, including landscaping and addressing maintenance issues if they arise. We're all pretty clean, and it's been easy to keep the bathrooms and common areas nice -- we share the costs of trash bags, toilet paper, etc. (which usually isn't much; when someone buys something for the house, they mark it on our spreadsheet so it is incorporated into the rent).

One last note: Sorry, but we can only have one person in the room, and aren't able to have cats or dogs in the house. Also, smoking is not allowed in the house.

The parking situation:
If you have a car, there's free parking on one side of MLK (excluding one street sweeping day per month), though it's a good idea to get a parking permit with the city for $55/year to be able to park anywhere in this part of town (you'd just need to re-register your car to this address).

You'd be joining four awesome housemates: 

Louis is a 4th year PhD student at Cal. A native Midwesterner and adopted East Coaster before heading west, he is still amazed by the number of hikes within 2 hours of Berkeley. Officially, he's training to be an environmental and energy economist. Unofficially, he's an avid foodie, an amateur pianist, an up-and-coming runner, and a recovering night owl.

Daniel is a 5th year PhD Student at Cal, who moved to Berkeley from Australia, although most folks think he sounds British (including some Australians). He loves reading, exercising, singing and coffee. He is indifferent to vegemite.

Andrea is an Architectural Designer, working towards becoming a full-blown Architect. She is originally from Sacramento and loves sports of any kind, preferring to play them rather than watch them. She also loves to cook, hike, bike, ski, kayak, creative projects, laugh and likes to keep things clean and organized.

Harrison is a jovial fellow who is fiercely proud of both his Bostonian and Greek heritages. He drives his car for Lyft whilst planning new travel adventures, and career moves. He also enjoys food, discussing politics, religion, and pretty much anything you want to talk about. He's an inquisitive soul.

We're all pretty low-key and maintain an easy-going environment in our house; people do their own thing, but we're all friendly and chat when we're cooking/hanging out/watching TV in the kitchen/common area. People are also always welcome to have friends over for dinner, to hang out, etc. Please feel free to contact us with any questions, or to set up a time to stop by the house.

This cozy, comfortable, very private ""Tiny Home/In-Law/Studio"" is a detached unit with a gently vaulted roof, and two skylights. 

It is a back yard studio with a private entrance. The colors are a warm off-white cream with pinewood trim. The canopy covered outdoor patio, accessed through double French Doors, leads out into the sunny backyard, with citrus, peach, and plum trees as well as other green fauna and trees waiting to be planted. We are communal in that we share the backyard areas; good communication is a must, so friendliness and a sense of humor go a long way! 

Approximately 400 sq feet inside, there is a full sized kitchen that includes a gas stove, dishwasher, refrigerator, microwave, and lots of pantry and cabinet storage. The bathroom has a large shower stall and is fully tiled with a glass block window for plenty of natural light and privacy. The outside patio is tiled and adds an extra 130 sq feet of outdoor living ability.

SEMI-FURNISHED with a folding table attached to the wrap-around built-in bookshelves, a queen bed, a hand built redwood bed base with more under bed storage, a small dresser of drawers and a corner shower caddy. If you have a bunch of furniture, this won't work.

Located between the Redwood and Laurel districts, this is a quiet street with great neighbors. Even while having quick access to all freeways, easy shopping and restaurants, there is a lot of privacy in this situation and it is very quiet as far as any freeway noise. 

Just minutes away from the Diamond, Joaquin Miller and Redwood parks, and all the fabulous redwood trails therein, there is quick access to the Colleges of Merritt, Mills and Holy Names.

With a short walk to the 35th or MacArthur Avenues, there is a great commute to SF via express bus or carpool, or to catch the main AC bus lines to BART, San Francisco, Berkeley, or downtown Oakland.
