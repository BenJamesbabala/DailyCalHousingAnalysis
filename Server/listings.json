{"listings": [{"description": "\n        \nLooking for a roommate to share a charming 2BR/1Bath apt in beautiful North Berkeley. The available room is the larger room and it gets great light from a long window looking out onto the street.  The room has two sizable closets and lots of storage space above the closets.  Rent for the room is $1500.\n\nThe apartment has a large open living room with a workable brick fireplace.  The kitchen is smaller but very cute, with a fledgling succulent garden in the window.  There is a shared laundry room on site as well as one designated parking spot for the unit.  Unlike most places in Berkeley, however, street parking is quiet ample and no permits are required.  The apartment is in a wonderful location, a block from Monterey Market, 15 minute walk to North Berkeley Bart, walking distance to several restaurants, and a short drive to Tilden Regional Park. The unit is a little further from Berkeley campus and the neighborhood is mostly families. The neighborhood is wonderful for walking or running and there is a track located a few blocks away.\n\nMy name is Lauren (31) and I'm a legal aid attorney.  I'm a very active person and I am usually out running or playing frisbee most nights of the week.  Although I have a fairly busy schedule, I try to find time to cook a meal or have a glass of wine at the house during the week.  In general, I prioritize exercise, clean eating and any and all outdoor activities.  I'm pretty laid back and I can get along with most people as long as they are clean and respectful.\n\nPlease email me if you are interested.

We are looking someone to stay from Jan 1 to May 31 of next year (or preferably longer!). If you like a cozy room with boatloads of natural light, this place is for you!\n\nWe live on the second floor of a newly-renovated house in a tree-lined residential neighborhood. It's in a fantastic location, nice and quiet, but ten minute walk to downtown Berkeley to the north, to Southside in the east, Ashby to the South. Just close enough to BART, Berkeley, for walking and just far enough that there is infinite street parking if you have a car or friends who do.\n\nOur spacious living room features an electric piano, communal workspace, and a slowly growing collection of board games. The dining room has an antique chandelier. There are all new appliances in the refurbished kitchen - electric range, stainless steel refrigerator, and disconcertingly powerful microwave. Washer and dryer are in unit and have loads of room. The garden and patio area behind the house are perfect for BBQs or outdoor events and the detached garage makes an excellent workspace if you're a maker or hacker. Street parking is ample and permit-free. We're also LGBT friendly. :)\n\nYour spacious (11' x 10') corner bedroom comes fully furnished (can also come unfurnished or less furnished if desired), has a private closet, and has two windows at a right angle for panoramic views and fresh cross breezes.\n\nOur variable lease (couples negotiable), permit-free street parking, and large communal space makes this room ideal for visiting scholars to UC Berkeley or LBNL, visiting professors, or faculty who want to combine the privacy of private room with the sociability of a shared apartment. \n\nWe are looking to create a fun relaxed house where people can work, socialize, and relax. If you are interested in making a home in Berkeley, please get in contact with us!\n\n\nA little about us:\n\nL: studied biochemistry, physics, and computer science at Cal, worked a stint as a software engineer and is currently venturing into the treacherous depths of personal entrepreneurship and discovering the meaning of life (beyond 42) in her mid twenties. Hacker, maker, artist, songmaker, and lifelong creative, she loves everything from building mind-controlled robots to discussing political philosophy to improvising on the piano. She is frequently found surreptitiously poking friends, giggling, and scampering off. L is a Gryffindor at heart and is looking for roommates who share her passion for building a better world, random ideas, or just making the world a little bit more interesting.\n\nMax, also in his twenties, works in materials science. He loves singing, cooking, science, and puns. He is also getting into music production and beer brewing. If you're wondering who buys those giant teddy bears from Costco, Max bought a giant teddy bear from Costco. Max is a Hufflepuff at heart and is looking for roommates who are similarly inclusive, dedicated, and excited about living near a magical kitchen. He likes baking, winning awards for making noise with his mouth, and sleeping on fuzzy substrates.\n\nGali:  Adorable 1-year-old kitten who loves snuggling and playing.  She's a quickly-growing ball of pure fluff who can turn anyone into a cat lover.\n\nL&J: Late 20s couple who work in transportation engineering and love biking, cooking, and the great outdoors.\n\nYou: A sociable and respectful 20s-30s human or pair of humans in tech, academia, or research. Down for board game nights, jam sessions, house outings, and/or weekly dinners. Excited about having housemates.\n\nWe're looking for people who would like to stay long term and help us make this apartment a home, however also excited to host people who are just passing through the Bay Area or aren't sure where they would like to end up. We are excited to host board game nights, musical jam sessions, house outings, and weekly dinners or brunches and we would love for you to join in. We are looking for people who want to have housemates and enjoy doing things.\n\nOur location gets a 67 on Walkscore and is a \"biker's paradise\". We are located\n\n15 minute walk to Downtown Berkeley BART\n20 minute walk to UC Berkeley campus\n20 minute walk to Trader Joe's or Berkeley Bowl\n1 block to 49 bus stop (straight shot to Campus)\n2 blocks to a Transbay bus stop\n2 blocks to Mo'Joe cafe with free WiFi\n62 miles below outer space\n\n\nThanks for reading!

The apt. is well maintained and will be cleaned upon the current tenant vacating...\n\nbut the thing that sets us a bit apart from the average apt. building is our community. we know our neighbors, we see them, say hello, and visit with each other. We sometimes cook dinner together. We hang out in our backyard area and bbq, or throw darts, or vent our frustrations about our GSI's. we are a mix of working professionals, retired elders, and students going to university. some residents are less social then others, and that's okay. but if you needed a movie buddy, or a pal for a bike ride, or a cat sitter, you wouldn't have to look far...\n\nAnd our biggest attribute is our grounds. we have worked hard to make our complex our home. we have landscaped our courtyard ourselves, we have cleared out parts of the backyard and put in a vegetable garden. we grow more tomatoes then we can handle. we also have a fence line of blackberries that explodes every summer. \n\nother stuff we have available is on-site laundry (two washers and two dryers), weekly recycling, secure on-site parking, and a bicycle storage area.\n\nwe are located near the corner of Grant and Dwight. a 10 minute walk to downtown. 15 minutes to campus. Equal distance between two Bart stations. Berkeley bowl is close enough to walk to as well...\n\nso hit that reply button.
